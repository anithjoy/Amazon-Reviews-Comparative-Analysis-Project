Ivan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023",At first I truly HATED these earbuds. I used the galaxy buds plus before them and believed they were superior in every single way. I would still repurchase a pair of those if these current ones do stop working but one of the earbuds went through a full washer and dryer cycle and still works just fine. It will be kind of glitchy when attempting to charge them in the case but the sound quality was not changed at all. One thing that is unforgivable in my opinion and was an issue from day one is the buds and the cases battery life. Its comical how fast they will be dying after using them for maybe a few hours
Vanessa A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2023","I had Samsung Buds Live. I really liked them but they slipped a lot. I looked around after one of the right charging prongs broke in the case. I came across these, they match my case colors and popsocket, so I bought them! I looooove them! They stay in my ears well, very comfortable and I can lay down comfortably with them in. Charge lasts much longer compared to my last buds, I really like that I can switch between ambient and nose reduction now. Connection was really easy, my phone picked them up right away, and I was able to keep my old buds case üòÅ"
Adrianne,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023","I really like them! I've never had high end earbuds before (Samsung buds, beats, airpods ect) so this would be my first, but the noise cancelling is good, and the sound is great! the only issue i have is that they don't work with calls. I have to talk super loud to be heard for some reason. I bought mine refurbished, so it probably had to do with that. Overall, I love the sound and the color is beautiful. I totally recommend!"
Galaxy Note User,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2023","This my 4th pair of galaxy buds. I purchased the original which I LOVED, then I upgraded to the plus, then the buds live, I loved them all. Now I have these and I have to say I'm kinda upset that I waited so long. I let reviews about them not fitting well enough stop me from purchasing bc I will be working, out among other thing with them on. But I have them and they fit perfectly just like the first generation. I have tested out chewing and shaking my head with them and they haven't budged. If that changes I'll update. But so far so good. The same great quality and sound as the previous buds!

I will say I was kinda thrown off by the white case I am used to case being the same color as the buds. Also I was never crazy about the square case that started with the buds live, so I had hopes the the original case would make a come back either way I'm still satisfied."
Whitnie Douglass,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023","have gone through a lot of ear buds in hopes to find the perfect pair. The sound on these bad boys is amazing. It will literally drawn out other sounds. It also plays a sound when you have them in your ears which is another feature I like and have not seen. There is one issue that has been appearing in most of the ear buds above 50$, the battery is equal or less than 4 hours. I have tried to do different ways they say can make the battery last longer but most of those tricks are in lifetime, not in one use. However, if you make sure they are 100% charged before you use them, then you get a little more time. But I am able to put them into the box to charge for about 30 minutes and I can get 8 more hours to finish my shift at work. I like them a lot, just wish the battery was"
sandysoyke,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023",Battery life was great. Sound quality was great. I could still hear other noise but then I have tried so many sets of earbuds and headphones and have not found any yet that are completely noise proof. So these are just as good as all the rest are claiming to be. Great job.
Nicholas Thibault,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023","I would love to give these a 5 star review, unfortunately they only have one flaw. I've been using these for a few months now, upgraded from my previous galaxy buds and they work seamlessly with my Samsung Galaxy S23+. They paired immediately and easily and they connect WHENEVER I remove them from my ear. No connectivity issues, audio quality is awesome and they seam to cancel or allow exterior noise based on whatever setting I use pretty well.

My only complaint, the design of these to automatically turn on and pair relies on their orientation. What's the issue? If I turn my head too far to one side or the other, they will disconnect as if taken out of my ear. This seamed to be a similar issue I had with my last ones but they weren't as sensitive. This is the only reason for 4/5 stars."
Alexa Resendiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023","Set up is super easy it only took me like a 3 minutes from when i opened the box to set it up on my phone(with the galaxy wearable app) . I had galaxy buds pro, that I loved but had accidentally put in the washer which sadly ruined them. I had strayed a little from samsung while looking a new pair but I was reminded of the last time I had brought non samsung headphones I got an ear infection.. so I settled on Galaxybuds2 and man am I happy, they are way more comfortable. My ears don't get as fatigued as they did when I wore my buds pro and they sound about the same. The seal is better at keeping sound out then my previous buds pro."
Savannah,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2023","Really great headphones ! Very similar quality to pairs I have gotten from Samsung website. I feel they are authentic, the ones sold online usually have some mistake with typos or design.
It does have trouble connecting to the wearable app and my phone on occasion, but for what I paid it's worth it"
opsmanp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2023",These earbuds fit well and the sound quality is pretty good. My only complaint so far is that the battery life is pretty short imo; needs recharge after an hour or so of use. I like these otherwise.
Brittany LaRay Creasman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023",My husband has the Galaxy buds and they have been more reliable than my airpods.

Josh Houlding,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2021","Galaxy Buds 2
I've been a big fan of the OG Galaxy Buds for the past two years I've owned them, so naturally I was interested in these new ones. However, not only could I not get them to fit snugly in my ears, I also encountered a plethora of small irritations that bothered me to the point of giving up on them. Here are some thoughts:

Pros
The audio quality is far superior to the original Galaxy Buds. There is a lot more bass and the audio has more depth to it for sure. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't exactly describe the way these sound in proper terminology too well, but they sound awesome to me.

Ambient sound mode is far and away better than the original Buds had. It is far easier to hear what is going on around you, and there are several levels of ambient sound so you can get exactly the amount of outside sound you need for your particular situation. It also doesn't have that faint hiss that the ambient sound mode on the original Galaxy Buds.

Cons
-Let's start off with one of the major selling points of these earbuds. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is marketed as quieting your environment so you can hear whatever you're listening to more clearly without having to turn the volume all the way up. However, I found that the ANC on these earbuds doesn't actually do much. It didn't filter out voices, music, papers rustling, or most other common noises very effectively, and even the constant hum of an air purifier in my room nearby wasn't cut down by that much. Considering the 33% hit to battery life you're taking by using the ANC, I would expect it to work well, and it definitely doesn't. In fact, the original Galaxy Buds have better noise cancellation, simply because they fit in my ears better and thus provide a better seal for noise isolation.

-They would not fit in my ears properly, no matter which eartip sizes I tried. This is the most fundamental aspect of a pair of earbuds for obvious reasons; it doesn't matter how many incredible features they have if they don't fit correctly. Keep in mind that these do not have any wingtips like the original Galaxy Buds to keep them secure in your ears, so they have a much greater chance of falling out and getting lost. Every time I yawned, ate, or did any other kind of jaw movement, they would come loose in my ears, and I would have to grab the buds and push/twist them back into place. This introduced even more problems, as I will discuss in the next few points. It's also worth mentioning that the ANC is worthless when the earbuds are loose, as there is no seal, defeating one of the main reasons to buy these over the original Buds or the Buds+.

-I'm not a big fan of the design of the Buds 2. They are very small, round and glossy, which means they are extremely difficult to grip compared to the original Galaxy Buds. The lack of wingtips makes this even worse, as I find myself gripping the wingtips when I'm putting in my Galaxy Buds or taking them out, and that feature is gone. Every major YouTuber seem to be fawning over the fact that these buds are smaller and lighter than previous iterations, but I don't see any meaningful increase in comfort from this design, and trying to grip these tiny things is incredibly frustrating. I was always worried I would drop them when trying to take them out of the case and put them in my ears. With the original Galaxy Buds, you had the wingtips, the touchpads on the ends, and matte-feeling plastic surfaces in the middle, so they were easy to grip when you wanted to put them in or remove them. The larger size didn't hurt, either. On the other hand though, these new Buds are a more unibody-like design, so it's not clear where the bud surface ends and the touchpad begins.

-The touch areas are poorly defined. It seems like every time I actually want to use them, I can't get them to activate, and when I just want to adjust the buds in my ears, they trigger, pausing or skipping whatever I'm listening to or watching. It's not clear where the actual touch surface is, so accidental presses are constant, and since they didn't fit me well, I was constantly having to touch the earbuds to adjust them, meaning plenty of accidental touches were had. The original Galaxy Buds didn't have this problem at all, as the triangular touchpads were clearly defined and easy to feel out due to their smoother texture compared to the rest of the buds. It may just be me, but I even felt like the original touchpads were far more responsive to my touches compared to the ones on these. The frustration I experienced with these touchpads really made me realize how much I use the touchpads on my original Galaxy Buds, and how functional they were in comparison to these.

-The case isn't as good as the original. They decided to have the cases for all colors be white, with the color of the specific buds in the middle. Why? Why do I have to have a white case? This may seem petty, but I would prefer a black case, or at least a darker color, and I don't get that option unless I shell out $20 more for a quality external protective case, which also adds bulk.
-Something I did with the original Buds case was utilize it as a phone stand. Because of its wide pill shape, it is surprisingly well-suited to this purpose. However, it is impossible to use the Buds 2 case for this purpose for several reasons. First, the more square shape means that when the phone is in landscape mode, pressing the sides of the phone screen will make the whole thing collapse, which is annoying as ****. Secondly, the glossy finish makes it too slippery to be used for this purpose anyway.
-Instead of going with a sleek matte finish like on the original case, Samsung decided to follow Apple and use a glossy finish on this new case, and I find it to be inferior for several reasons. One, fingerprint magnet. Two, it makes the case so slippery to hold that I'm afraid I'll drop the damn thing and lose my $150 earbuds when I'm out and about and trying to get them out. The matte finish on the original case didn't have either of these problems, it was grippable enough and didn't collect finger oil like a smartphone screen.
-The square shape of this case means that charging it on a wireless charging stand is impossible. With the original, the pill shape meant it could be stood up on its short end and the Qi wireless charging coils would meet up, meaning it could be charged on wireless charging stands in addition to flat pads. This extra level of flexibility was awesome, and I used it to great effect many times. Not an option with this new case.
-Petty complaint, but the snap when you close this new case is far inferior to that of the original case. Closing your earbud case with a satisfying snap after you're done using them is great, and it's not as much so here.

-Eartips aren't that great. Not only did I have problems with the fit, but when I took the earbuds out of my ears, the tips would turn inside out half the time, which would require correction. I don't know if they're using inferior materials or what, but regardless, another minor annoyance I have to deal with a significant portion of the time when I want to stop using them.

-No popup when opening the case and auto-pairing the buds. The Galaxy Buds and Buds+ show a card at the bottom of the phone screen displaying either the battery content of the buds (original buds) or the battery content of the buds and the case (buds+). For some reason, I never got a popup like this when I opened the case of the Buds 2. Why? It was nice to be able to see battery percentage upon opening the case without having to go into the app or create a dedicated widget on the home screen to monitor it. The Buds+ also have a nice animation of the buds flying out of the case and to their respective positions on the popup, a nice visual touch borrowed from Apple. It's possible that this needs to be enabled in the app somewhere, but I never had to do that with the original Galaxy Buds 2 I have, and I can't imagine Samsung would make the UX mistake of requiring a dig through the Wearable app to enable such a simple feature.

I'm terribly sorry if this review is overly long and nitpicky. I'm just interested in presenting every thought I had throughout the course of trying to like these earbuds in order to give you a more complete picture of what you might be able to expect if you buy these. They aren't bad by any means, but when you get annoyed a bit by this minor problem and a bit by that minor problem and so on, the nitpicks add up to significant frustration, and that made me quit even trying, sell these to my brother for $140, and go back to my original Galaxy Buds, which are tried and true. I am considering buying the Buds+ for my return to college instead, as they combine the tried-and-true design of the original Galaxy Buds with the best features of these new Buds 2, notably better audio quality and ambient sound mode. They also hold 11 hours of playback time in the buds alone, vs. 7.5 hours for the Buds 2 with ANC off, and 5 with it on. The case is also much better than the case for these new ones, and they are $50 cheaper to boot.

Hopefully some of this helped you come to a decision, and I hope you have a nice day.

Jarrod,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2023","My experience with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 was decidedly negative for a couple of small reasons and one big reason. To begin with the positives, the noise cancellation worked decently well. I don't have much of a baseline because I had never owned a noise cancelling product before, but they did what they advertised - made noisy spaces quieter such that I could get work done in an office where people were talking and the bus wasn't so loud as to give me a headache. Sound quality was okay. The battery life wasn't great (again, very little for me to compare to) but the fact that they could recharge in the case was neat and made limitations on the buds' battery life manageable. Because having them in for many hours is uncomfortable anyway, they always got a break to recharge in the case and they always seated well in their little charging spots.

That does bring up a point about comfort - namely, they weren't uncomfortable at first but became so after about an hour. Not surprising, especially given how they aspire to be low profile and, thus, are primarily hard shell that sits entirely inside one's ear, but it still must be said. Also they didn't stay in my ears particularly well with any of the cups they included. This became very irritating because pushing them back into my ears as they fell out would pause my music or skip tracks because as it triggered touch commands. The way to avoid this for me was to turn off touch commands with the app, but then I could only control the ear buds (pause, play, change noise cancellation setting) through my phone - which I couldn't do if I had the buds connected to another device (like my laptop, which was typical).

More to the point - after a few (3-4) weeks of owning my Galaxy Buds, they broke. The sound in the left ear became very scratchy and got worse over time, sometimes cutting out almost entirely. I sought help on Samsung's site, since my product was very new and this is where the problems really began. Samsung's customer service is abysmal - probably the worst I've ever dealt with, and that puts them in competition with Cox Communications. There is no e-mail address for me to contact. The phone number on their website isn't helpful. The online chat forces you to go through an extremely unintelligent bot, which is frustrating. The interface when using the chat is occasionally opaque. The people I've been connected to are unhelpful and frequently difficult to communicate with, with less English competency on average than I would expect for such a customer-facing position. Eventually I was able to return the ear buds to be repaired. This took a week or two and they came back fixed.

The fix lasted for about one week and the left ear bud stopped working again. I was disappointed with the quality of the product I had bought and decided I would just return it. This is not possible through Samsung - you can only return things (within the warranty) to have them repaired! I tried to reason with the poor customer service tech who was obviously not authorized to do anything for me except initiate the repair process. Eventually I caved and accepted another repair. They did not initiate the process but *did* close the chat, forcing me to spend another 45 minutes going through the process again with someone else.

And so I sent them off again. After getting an e-mail informing me that my product would not be returned to me, then receiving another e-mail informing me that it would, I eventually got a NEW set of ear buds in the mail after about three weeks. These, too, failed in the same manner as the first after a month. I never did anything with the buds except put them in and take them out, I have no idea why they're so poorly made. I then spent the next several months, on and off, trying to return them. Every time I interacted with their customer service I had to walk away for a couple weeks so I didn't say something really mean to the poor useless idiot that was 'assisting' me this time. I had one guy tell me to ""hold on"" while he got some information, then kick me for inactivity. I had somebody tell me that they were going to transfer me to someone who could help and then close the chat - nothing ever popped up. I did manage to get one guy to set up a phone call with someone higher up on a Tuesday at 6PM. I waited for them to call but they never did - until noon the next day, when I picked up to a robocall telling me that I had reached Samsung customer service and that nobody was available to take my call. It then hung up. Which was rude. The most recent interaction I had was with a guy who was adamant that *he* couldn't do anything for me (including giving me the phone number or e-mail address of someone more useful), but that a local licensed Samsung service center could. Samsung's website has a map of authorized service centers near you! I went there while he stayed on the line and they told me that, in fact, they don't service ear buds and that the customer service tech was lying to me. I came back and duly informed Khaja K. of that development and he told me ""Let me transfer to order team to get it replacement"", followed by the familiar message telling me ""We are transferring your case to the appropriate team, a new chat window will open up in few seconds to message that team."" Invariably, the chat closes and nothing else ever pops up. It does not even allow you to type anymore at that point.

The moral of this story is that the Galaxy Buds 2 are probably overpriced, but if you get a pair that isn't as flawed as mine were, they might be an okay product. However, if anything ever goes wrong, you've done your money. Godspeed. If I could give this product zero stars I would, because they haven't worked for more than a month at a time in the eight months or so I've owned them. I've returned them twice and, after probably five or six *more* interactions with customer service, neither I nor my ear buds have been served. It's actually miserable interacting with them. This concludes my review of both the product and the company that manufactures it."
Selma campos,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023","Sounds works great Even in the shower, color is a pretty olive green which not a lot of people would like so it was sale. Setting it up with your phone or tablet is super fast. Battery life is like a couple hours so it's not bad."
Paul O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2023","I purchased these to replace an 8 month old set Jabra 75T Active earbuds - the volume in the right earbud died. Common issue with Jabra (try an internet search). Jabra CS wasn't much help with a fix and didn't honor any kind of warranty.

Comparing with the Jabra...

Samsung earbuds have better noise cancelling features. Example, you can adjust the level of hear-thru volume. There's also a feature to disable the touch control, which comes in handy when you're inserting the earbuds in your ears.

Pairing is super easy and connection with your paired devices happens when you open the charger. Unlike the Jabra, there's no need to have to have to return them to the charge case in order to reset them.

You can wear one earbud if you choose, either right or left. With the Jabra, you're limited to the right earbud only.

The earbuds are easy to keep clean. The removable silicone cups have a separate screen barrier to keep out earwax and grime from getting into the earbud itself.

The only complaint is the smooth texture of the earbuds make them slippery when handling outside the ears.

Battery life is good if the noise cancellation/hear-thru features are turned off. Charging can be performed with any Samsung adaptive charger.

I chose the Samsung ear buds because they use the same Wear app my other Samsung devices use. I've found that staying within brand is less glitchy."
Holly Ahearn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023","I reluctantly purchased these after a different pair of earbuds I had died. I'm so glad I decided on these! Not only are they really pretty but they are, by far, the best earbuds I've ever used.

Noise cancelling - they really are noise cancelling! I went on a road trip with my kids in the car and I wasn't able to hear their bickering or singing. It was glorious being able to submerse myself in a book. I'm not 100% sure if this is me imagining things but it seems as if there is a slight white noise produced right before audio starts. It's very minimal but it keeps outside noise from creeping in.

What ya get and colors - the earbuds are a smooth, shiny lavender that match my Samsung watch and phone. The case came partially charged and is white. There is also a white USB cord. It came with 3 different sizes of ear pieces to perfect your sizing.

The app - you'll need to download the Samsung Wearable app. The app allows you to keep track of how charged the case and each earbud is. There's noise and touch controls as well. When first setting up the app, it has you put the earbuds in your ears to determine if they fit ok. With the help of the app I found out that I needed two different sizes of ear pieces to get the best fit.

I've mowed the lawn with them and despite sweating and doing a lot of moving, they stayed in without a problem. I've used them for about 3 hours consecutively and they played perfectly the whole time, never running out of charge. When I make calls, nobody has had trouble hearing me. I can stop or start music by simply tapping an earbud.

These earbuds are worth every penny. If you're on the fence, get them because you won't regret it!"
natalie mckinney,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023","Love love love these. The sound quality is awesome, reasonably priced and they are noise canceling."
Jesse,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2023","As a user, I love the bugs. They are amazing for listening to music or calls. One really awesome feature I noticed the other day is we were at the neighborhood pool and I was sitting at the table (not wet) and put them in to listen to some music. I had not turned on my music yet, as soon as I put them it, it was like ear plugs, blocking ALL noise. I was sitting next to the ""kiddie"" pool which had ""mushrooms"" (towers that poured water out like a waterfall, and within 5 seconds, it sounded like my earbuds were playing ocean sounds. It knew the water was a soothing sound and actually piped them through to my ears while still blocking out the sound of our kids screaming and running around in the pool.

The ONLY complaint I have is about talking on phone. While it is great for me, I have only had complains about people not being able to hear me. I have used it in the car, people complain and connected to my PC for ""Teams"" meetings, people always complain that I sound muffled. I stopped using them to talk on phone (went back to vehicle bluetooth) and PC (went back to my USB headset) and everything sounds clear according to everyone who is listening. Not sure if there is a setting I need to change for that but I didn't see anything obvious in the settings."

Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023","These are some of the best earbuds i have ever encountered, bar none. The audio quality is fantastic and the comfort is great. Only a couple of little gripes, the earbuds have a hard time staying in the ears, especially when moving around. The touch controls are a little too sensitive or unresponsive at times. Other than that these work great. Last complaint would probably be the price. These compare to 80 dollar earbuds and for the price they could be better."

Kenny,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023",Overall amazing sound and battery life
Cheetahboy3000YT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2023","I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy Bud 2 and I'm very impressed with them. The sound quality is excellent and the noise canceling is amazing, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcasts without any distractions. The Bluetooth connectivity is actually good and has been stable with a good range. I can go outside with them on and leave my phone inside the house and still hear my music with no connection issues.

The touch controls are intuitive and easy to use, better than the ones you can find on AirPods but I do find them a bit sensitive and have accidentally paused or skipped tracks before. The battery life is impressive, with the buds lasting for several hours on a single charge. However, I do find the charging case to be a bit bulky and the design is not as sleek as I would like.

The only major issue I have with the Samsung Galaxy Bud 2 is the odd design, compared to other high quality wear buds on the market they just look weird to me. They don‚Äôt look as cool as airpods or raycon earbuds. It also Selma like the build quality has gotten worse since the galaxy bud pros. The case is made with a lighter more cheap feeling plastic.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Bud 2 to anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds with excellent noise canceling, impressive battery life, and intuitive touch controls. The minor drawbacks, such as the odd design and but it is easily outweighed by the impressive features and performance of these earbuds."
Noah Sheldon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023","I bought these buds a few months back.

The Good

I bought them to use at school and when going for walks and biking. For that they generally do a good job, the samsung wearables app works well and features quite a bit to tinker with including sound modes and a graphic EQ if your into that, the buds even auto pair when you open the charging case. The 3 sets of ear tips that are included makes it much easier to find a good fit. But how about sound quality? They sound fantastic I am amazed by the detail everytime I listen especially considering these are cheaper wireless buds. The battery life is also quite good, you can easily get several hours as long as you put them in the case every so often.

The Bad
My first gripe might seem small but the case is a glossy finish and is smudged very easily giving it a less than stellar look. I also don't find these very comfortable with any of the tip sizes, and strugle to wear them for more extended listening periods. Not only that but my brother who also bought a pair of these even before me is experiencing quite a few issues including, the left bud barely putting out any sound, and most recently one of his ear tips completely ripping. We looked up solutions and came across a plethora of threads listing similar issues, so it seems like a possible QC problem.

The Verdict

Overall they are pretty good buds especially if you can snag them on sale, but beware of possible QC issues. A warranty might be a smart idea."

work great and excellent"
Daniel A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2022","I've been using an older set of Bose Headsets since sometime around 2014. It's the model that doesn't cover the ear, but it was always great a canceling noise, and the sound quality while watching movies on my tablet was great. The headset was wired, and it came with 2 batteries and a plug-in wall charging device. They were used, but high quality, noise canceling and when the ear muff pleather goes bad, you can replace them easily. It's been a tank for me, but they were bulky to pack when you're trying to travel lite with a carry-on and personal item. Additionally, I was ready for a wireless bluetooth solution. I will also preface that this is not my first attempt at noise canceling earbuds, I had purchased an ""Amazon"" off brand, on sale $49 set a couple of years back, and perhaps I didn't do something right when using them, but I just felt they plugged my ears, more so then it actually having a Noise Canceling feature (there's a difference, I'll get to that).

I was getting ready for a New York trip where I needed to consolidate as much space as possible, because in this particular occasion I had a carry-on and a personal item. So, I ran across, a deal where the olive color SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 were going just shy of $99. Based off the reviews, it appeared to get the job done, albeit I was still a bit skeptical since the price was excellent, and I thought simply plugging the ear with a bud and filling it with music or sounds from a movie was good enough to call it noise canceling.

Result? I was pleasantly surprise how great these things were, there's a bit of trick to the ear buds when you don't have actual buttons to push, but it's a simple as holding your finger on the ear bud for a period of time turns on and off the noise canceling feature, and tapping the ear bud pauses it. And yes, I could tell the difference when I used the noise canceling feature, and it was freaking great in my opinion. I only used to watch a television series on my Amazon Fire Tablet, but it was fantastic, I have absolutely no complaints for the time I used it on the trip. Until I make a significantly longer trip (2 hrs for me to get to NY), I will not know how good the battery life is, or how long this product will last overall, but for $100, I highly recommend this product if you want a lean ear bud that noise cancels and sounds great watching movies and/or tv shows are your tablet."
TheStarsFan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023","I have been reluctant to buy Samsung phone products to mate up with my Galaxy phone, because quite frankly, they just haven't been that great. The reviews on this were better than other products, so I thought I would give them a shot.
Pros:
Integration with my Galaxy phone is exactly as it should be. Cake.
An app to let you make some adjustments on your phone instead of remembering a series of buttons.
Sound is great for a sub $100 true wireless ear bud
No audio latency on videos.
Battery/storage is nice. Love the magnet to keep buds from falling out.
Simple design.
Cons:
The touch controls on the buds are a bit confusing when you don't want to use your phone for adjustments.
They don't seem to fit in my ears as well as others. Tried different option sizes, but still feel like I have to adjust them a lot. I have fairly large ears, so I don't know why this is.

Overall, I am happy. Great sound at a really good price."

Ryan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2023","I bought these earbuds as I was looking for buds that sound good, fit well in the ear, and do not stick out of/hang down from my ears; these do the trick well!
They integrate well with the Galaxy Wearable app, with features including battery level display, equalizer settings, earbud fit test, ""find my earbuds"", reprogrammable touch pad controls, and various other earbuds settings.
I am a big fan of the active noise canceling (ANC), ambient sound, and the ability to switch between the two by just using the touch pads on the sides of the earbuds. One small downside is the inability to access these functions while using only one earbud; not an issue for ANC as you wont get that anyway with only one, but I like to use just the one while I drive, and miss being able to still hear the ambient sounds.
The earbuds are small, round, and smooth, which can make them difficult to grip when holding and placing in/out of ears. Occasional tendency to activate the touch pad when adjusting in ears.
--Like:
Comfortable in ear
Easy to pair with devices
Integration with Galaxy Wearable app
Wired/wireless charging, fast charge, good battery life
ANC and ambient sound settings.
Receptive touch pads on outside of earbuds to pause/play/skip music and answer/hang up phone calls
--Dislike:
Inability to use ambient sound setting while using only one earbud
Outside of case only comes in white color
Smooth and round surface of earbuds leads to difficulty gripping them in fingers
Tapping the touch pads to pause/skip music can sound like an echoing plastic-y sound in the ears"

Christopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2022","I bought these because i got a new phone recently (Samsung Galaxy flip 3), and since it doesnt have a normal headphone jack, i bought an adapter and used it until i could purchase these.

Mine were in a Sealed box, so not opened like i saw some say on here. they will need to be charged once you get them, or at least mine were. i synched them to my phone and saw the buds were at 3% and the case 39%. you will need the app Samsung Wear, which was preinstalled on my phone so no biggie, to use them i believe.

FIT:

They fit in my ears just fine out of the box, no playing, no having to swap the ear tips. you should place them in your ear so the insert is on the bottom, and the bulb upwards, gently guide it into your ear until it fits snugly. the Samsung Wear app also had a ""Test the Fit"" feature that said i had a good fit, so whatever works.

Battery: I listened to music and played with them for about an hour, on an almost Max volume, and they only dropped about 10-15%, so easy 10 hours for me at minimum, which i wont ever listen to music that long so perfect for me.

Sound: Sound quality is great, just as good as my old Skullcandy Headphones, if not better. found a good Equalizer for me was ""Dynamic"", had just the right sound for my tastes listening to Hard rock/Metal.

Additional Features:

The Noise Cancelling isnt total silence. It definitely lowers the outside volume by about half, but even still, listening to music just blots out whatever is left.

The Ambient Sound feature does work, and it sounds like you're on a call with someone, however you will not hear anything listening to music loudly, i tested it by playing a Podcast video on my PC while listening to different levels. the music would have to be at a very quiet level to hear anything. so better to pause and unpause.

The touch features i havent had any issue with as of yet. It doesnt have any buttons or anything like that, just the face of the earbuds. you tap against that to use touch features, and they CAN be turned off via Samsungs Wear app.

Overall id give them a 5, since the Noise Cancellation/Ambient sound features arent too big of a dealbreaker for me. they are comfortable, great sound quality, and so convienient not having to bring Wired headphones where i go anymore."
RAdams,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2021","A lot of early reviews describe the ANC (Automatic Noise Canceling) for the Buds 2 as ""meh."" Fair enough, this is my first experience with that technology so I don't have any other frame of reference so bear that in mind. I'm confident that over the ear headphones most likely the best. But these are buds - how much can they do? Do you really want to wear heavy headphones as you mow the yard?

Here are my observations comparing Galaxy Buds 2 to my old $20 wired cheapies.

1) I ran a noisy, everyday box fan and turned on ANC. It easily halved the volume from that. It almost seemed like I'd remotely turned off the fan.

2) I started and ran the lawn mower and then turned on ANC. It easily halved the volume. I still heard it, but it was much quieter.

3) A couple times cars drove down the street in front of my house while the mower was off. I didn't hear them at all.

4) If I put my head in front of the fan I could hear a windy/buffeting sound just like any other buds. Just like when my lazy coworkers call me from the golf course and assign my extra duties. You know what I'm talking about.

Yes, I could still hear the fan and the mower, but I was able to turn down the volume of my podcast quite a bit to hear clearly. I'm really attracted to the idea of listening at a lower volume to protect my hearing.

I'm sure it's too late for anybody to read this review amongst the thousands already written, but I'll update it tomorrow after I run my line trimmer, edger & leaf blower while taking care of yardwork for any of you weirdos who have an interest in that.

TLDR: No, it's not the ""cone of silence"" from Get Smart but it's worthwhile.

The sound is pretty neutral compared to my Tin t3+ iems but is still enjoyable. The fit of the earbuds for me were pretty loose, even after trying all the ear tips that came with it.

Playback of recorded media has a fuller sound, better bass handling, and the earbuds stay charged longer. However, callers report a diminished pickup on the microphone, and I've already tested them with different noise settings.

I have an old Jabra single-ear unit, and the mic is far better. While I seldom shout at the phone (and don't hold it out like a piece of toast), the caller feedback still demonstrates a lack of sensitivity on the ports."

The person(s) on the other end said the background noise on my side is not that bad so that area of noise cancelation is excellent. Noise cancelation on my side is incredible. The sound quality is fantastic. I listen to a lot of smooth jazz and the acoustics are excellent. The shape of the buds makes them difficult to remove. They're easily dropped when finally removed. The battery life is ok. I typically wear one unless on a call so I'm able to stretch my battery life. The battery for 1 earbud will be at 10 to 15% by 1130a if used constantly from 7a to 1130a. I assume they both would be dead if used together. Especially if the noise cancelation is on. The ambient noise filter is pretty cool. It would be better if closer sounds would be amplified. Using it, I can't hear a person that's talking right next to me very well. Overall, they're a great choice. I recommend."
Stephanie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","Pros: I have very small ears and the lower size buds were great for that.
These are extremely comfortable as I use these at work for many hours at a time.
The ear detection works really well for taking them out when I need to talk with a coworker it will pause nearly immediately.
This may be trivial but I like the clamshell case and the earbuds go back into it for charging fairly easily.
I'm not a snob for sound quality as I normally only use 1 earbud at a time in case I need to talk to someone at work but it seems very clear and there's very little ""coil whine"" like sound from some cheaper earbuds.
The noise cancellation on these is actually really really good. Very similar to using over ear headsets.

Cons:
They don't have the best grip compared to some of the other earbuds I've used so for hard exercise or a lot of movement they will probably fall out.
The battery life seems like it works for each ear for about 6 hoursish which is about a workday for me if I have them charging during interruptions or breaks at work. I wish it was a little longer so I wouldn't have to remember to charge mid day.
My earbuds had a sound quality issue that I'm hoping will get repaired. They're currently on the way to Samsung for repair. It started with my right ear buds max volume output being almost impossible to hear. You couldn't make out most words in videos or lower tones in songs. When this happened I also noticed that the buds would make a screeching sound if I had both buds in at the same time with either the noise cancelling or ambient noise setting on. This occurred even at 0 bluetooth volume. I then only used the left side for a few months before the same issue happened to it as well leaving me with unworkable ear buds and causing me to send them in. For those that are experiencing this issue I wish you luck resolving it as I've tried cleaning them and reinstalling the Samsung wearable app. This is not an issue with my other earbuds. I'm hoping that I just got a defective set and Samsung will get me a working pair.
Overall:
Unfortunately, their very few buds for people like me with small ears and I like the versatility of these buds. I hope the ones that I got were just defective and that others enjoy these earbuds."

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2022","I had and loved the samsung galaxy buds plus for around the two years I owned them, and the only reason that I purchased this model was because they got stolen, as I saw this model was a generation newer and was on sale for cheaper than the listings of the original samsung galaxy buds plus. This turned out to be one of the worst mistakes I made and I should have read more reviews than trusting that they couldn't mess up a pair of earbuds that badly when the first generation were very good (imo).

First talking about the postitives: the sound quality is very good, the bluetooth connection both with samsung and windows devices is very quick and easy, and the samsung integrations with my phone (samsung s9) are pretty good.

However, in no way would I recommend buying these earbuds at all. Here are the negatives I noticed in under 4 months of somewhat frequent use:
Firstly (and most importantly in my opinion), the in ear fit is absolute garbage. I tried using all three of the provided ear tips and with all of them if I so much as looked downwards, the earbuds would start to slip out of my ears. The original buds plus a rubber wing of sorts on them to help the earbuds stay in your ear, but it seems like for some reason they chose to make the design look more aesthetically pleasing, leading to there being nothing except the silicon ear tip to help it stay in your ear. I tried to place the earbuds in every orientation in my ears, attempting to brace the earbuds somewhere to keep them from falling out of my ears to no avail. Keep in mind this happened through simple movements like lowering my head to chop vegetables in the kitchen or just simply walking forwards, it would only take under a couple of minutes for me to have to readjust the earbuds in my ears to keep them from falling out.
This readjusting would then lead to it pausing whatever I was listening to since they must have increased the touch sensitivity for these earbuds, because it would register a touch even if I touched the earbuds with my shoulder even when I was wearing a sweatshirt. I'm not including this as a distinct negative I noticed, as some people might appreciate the increased touch sensitivity, as it can even register touches when wearing gloves in my experience, but in combination with having to readjust the earbuds every couple of minutes from them slipping out of my ears it did become an annoyance.

Secondly, the reliability/durability of the earbuds is also garbage. Within 3 months of use, the left earbud flat out stopped working, I was doing some work in a workshop (cutting wood and metal) and I heard some static coming from the left earbud before it stopped outputting volume entirely. With only an IPX2 rating for dust/water protection maybe some sawdust or metal particles got in the earbud and shorted something out, but it wasn't a ridiculous amount of particles I was spraying everywhere, so for it to fail within 3 months of purchase is just unacceptable for earbuds which are supposed to be for daily use.
I tried updating the samsung app, using it with three other devices, and making sure that both the earbuds and the case were fully recharged, nothing fixed the left earbud, which is even more disappointing because that was the one that fit slightly better in my ear (only requiring readjusting every 5-10 minutes as opposed to around 3-5 minutes on the right ones).

Thirdly, the case is very annoying, as any time you drop the case, it opens, sending the earbuds flying out across the floor. This might have been a personal problem, as I usually kept the case in my pocket along with my keys, but occasionally when I would pull out my keys the case would come tumbling out along with them, leading to me having to search the surrounding floor for where the headphones had flown off to.

In conclusion do not buy, the sound quality is good and the ANC is fine (albeit not great since the in-ear fit doesn't fully isolate incoming sound), but the in ear fit and durability of these make them utterly unusable for even the simplest tasks much less something like use in exercising where the earbuds will fall out even more."
N. Ard,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2023",They sound great and the anc works pretty well to cut grass with. Mine act weird about tapping though. If I ever tap on the left earbud the right will no longer work. Assume it's a software issue.

Arianna,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2022","20 min usage review. I will update if anything changes.

I've tried 3 other much more expensive pairs of ear buds (bose, apple, Sony) before landing on these. The others would hurt my head, L ear, and trigger migraines, which I rarely get. Some you couldn't turn noise processing off. These samsung ones cause a very small amount of pain near the left ear, but it is bearable, which I'll take for the convenience of buds. You can also adjust the ambient noise volume, and turn off processing completely. The ambient mode sounds natural and there's next to no latency unlike I noticed on higher end buds. Controls are intuitive.

Additionally, the design is sleek and feels well built. The material feels like airpods through and through, which I love. It's portable and not clunky, easy to open and close. The small size is very comfortable and easy to insert.

The audio quality is great. It has crisp highs, decent lows. It's better than my bose soundlink, although those have literally been dragged through the mud multiple times, so take that with a grain of salt.

Small complaint: it didn't come with a USB c charger like it said. (I ordered refurbished)

Update: still love the buds. Some minor complaints: ears get itchy sometimes, buds get warm occasionally, buds may play music when you're adjusting the bud due to the tap, but these can be changed in settings. Tap is on both sides (annoying for adjusting). Mic works well as far as I can tell. Great battery life. Buds kind of stick together due to magnet which is good if you're setting down."
Lourene,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023",This would be my second set of Samsung ear buds. I was perfectly satisfied with my last ones until they fell out of my pocket and I didn't realize that one fell out. So I was now missing one. This new set and I believe maybe two generations removed from my prior set the sound quality is 100% better. I don't have to turn the volume up nearly as loud and the quality is perfect. I usually listen with only one in at a time so that I can switch them out and it's amazing the difference. If I use both at the same time I'm lost to the noise around me. That wasn't the case with the previous pair. The fit it finaminal and I'm not worrying about them falling out of my ears all the time either.

At least for standard earbuds, they are great. The touch function works as expected, you can customize the multi tap feature, and it works with third party music applications.

Now for the most glaring problem: once you activate the noise canceling or ambient pass through, there seems to be a level of either compression or something that makes music and sound hard to hear without static. It's terrible. I don't even use the function.

I‚Äôve had AirPod pros previously & these are a disappointment when it comes to noise cancellation with in ear headphones! I can still hear everything it‚Äôs just muffled. I did the fit test in the app on my android when setting up. I am however very pleased with the fitment of them!

I would personally never pay full price for these. I purchased in the ‚Äúused‚Äù condition but the buds themselves looked to be untouched as well as the accessories.

The battery life sucks compared to the AirPod pros they die fairly quick even when not in use but in my ears with ANC off.

Also beware if you‚Äôre using with apple products you you may benefit from setting up on an android to play with settings etc, so if you have an android phone/tablet you can use to download the app and adjust some things then you‚Äôll be good to go.

The iPhone app is only compatible with the Buds live & buds plus so that sucks lol. These are great for me temporarily."

Jared Lovelady,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022","I tried all the tips. These things are simply just too big if you don't have large ear canals. I tried watching a video and even read hot to insert them properly. That wasnt the issue.
Even when I used the app and got it to say the fit ""was good"" they would fall out while sitting at my desk within minutes. God forbid I even tried to walk around with them and any time I bent down I could instantly feel them staying to slip out.

Additionally, the sound is pretty good, but if you use the ambient sound, even on low, it's echo-y. Having a washing machine or dryer on and ambient on low makes it sound like the washer and dryer are in front of my face vs in the other room 20 feet away. Every breath I take on low ambient is loud and distorted. I'm not a loud breather.

Noise cancellation is just okay, but not amazing. Maybe it's because they're too big for my ear canals? When the ambient sound is off the sound quality is decent. However, it's disturbing that you can't tell left from right ears via sound like normal headphones. It's like the sound is inside your head and it's almost disturbing.

The music or podcasts stopping when you remove the earbuds is great. The tapping them to play or double tapping them to go to the next one is great. They are very responsive. The look of them is nice and they seem sturdy/quality, not cheap. For all that I'll give 3 stars. They are bulky and a lot larger in size than I imagined as well - not talking about the ends that fit in your ears, but the actual buds themselves don't really even sit fully inside the ear bends themselves. I'm an average sized person,5'8"". If you're petite these probably aren't going to work for you.

These are just not for me and I was so excited about them. I tried them several times, multiple hours, over 4 days trying to hopefully get them to be okay for me, but they just aren't."
Evan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2023","I upgraded to these while they were at a discounted price of $100. Very comfortable. They're affordable even without the discount. The sound quality is really good. It's hard for these to fall out of my ears. Definitely worth it if you're trying to match with your Samsung Galaxy. They work well together and since they are built for Samsung devices, the sound quality is better and they are easier to work with. The noice cancellation feature works really well, as well as the ambient sound. My main problem regards the touch controls. They work good otherwise, but the spot to use the touch controls is not defined at all. This means that you'll have trouble pushing the button before it responds. This isn't a very big deal, but it can lead to some very awkward public interactions if someone needed your attention. This is my experience, though."
CHRISTOHER DANIEL LOSH,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023","The day the galaxy buds2 arrived, I was completely satisfied. However, on day two, the volume in the left bud went very low and would not go up. Now there is only an almost inaudible beep and crackling in the left bud. Im nearly 50 and these were the first wireless earphones I've ever tried. I suppose I'll be going back to the wired standard."
R. Thomas,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022","I'm upgrading from a three year old cheep pair of earbuds. I went from 30 minutes of battery life to 5 hours on one charge. The sound quality is good but nothing special. I do like that you have several equalizer settings on the app. I could barely tell the difference between the ANC on or off. It has the hardware for ANC but it isn't good. The majority of the noise cancelation comes from simply having the headphones on. I have a seven year old pair of Bose QuietComfort 20 and you can easily tell when ANC is on or off. I haven't really used the ambient sound setting but it seems ok. The fit is good but they do shift out a little when I move my face muscles, like smiling or yawning. Regardless of the shifting, they haven't fallen out at all. Honestly I feel like the only noticeable differences between these and my old buds is the battery life and Bluetooth range. Overall they are unremarkable. I'm sure you could find a comparable quality pair of buds for half the price. I got mine used, so they cost half the price.

Update. It's been several months since my original review. Running with them is ok but I usually turn off the touch controls since I have to constantly have to keep pushing them back in. The touch functions can be too sensitive at times, especially when all you're trying to do is push them back in. I always try to just touch the top and bottom but somehow I still touch the middle. Using them for calls or while eating will cause them to slowly push out of your ear so I constantly have to push them back in. I've accidently hung up on people several time because of this. I tried using the Labs edge tap for volume, It sucks. If I'm talking or eating it will chance the volume randomly. I'm aware that it is caused by my ear touching the sides while I'm chewing or talking but it's still sucks. Going back to the ANC, It does work in certain situations. It works ok for the train but not a mower in the distance. It can muffle a fan but not a vacuum.

Why did I keep them? Even with all the things I don't like they are much better than my old earbuds. I like the equalizer and that they are a Samsung product that seamlessly pairs with my Samsung products. They work well with most of my Bluetooth capable devices. Would I recommend them? All I can say is try them for yourself If you can and decide. Thankfully Amazon has a generous return policy."
Robin Dixon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2022","So, good things about these earbuds first:
1.) they sync up quickly and effortlessly.
2.) The sound quality is really good and you can adjust it with the app on Samsung devices.
3.) You can lay your head on a pillow and the sound will not get muffled like with other cheaper earbuds.
3.) They are very comfortable.
4.) They DON'T do the annoying thing that some Bluetooth headphones do (like my Raycons or Taotronics that I had before these) where they will disconnect for a couple milliseconds every once in a while.

Okay, now some really annoying things which makes me give them 3 stars instead of 5:
1.) THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. If you have the app, you can change what the taps do, what the sensitivity is, and if you want them to be off or on. I have recently just been keeping them turned off all the time. I love being able to tap my earbuds to pause, long hold to change the volume, etc. However, these stupid earbuds have touch sensitivity instead of actual buttons, which means if you want to adjust your ear buds or take one out to listen to someone or whatever, you will pause your music/podcast/whatever about 75% of the time. Even if you're really careful just to grab the slim, slick edges. And what REALLY irks me is when you're outside and sweaty and your HAIR touches the darn thing, changing songs, blowing your eardrums out by increasing the volume, pausing your media, skipping to the next track UGH. It makes the touch controls completely useless when you are exercising, which is when I want them the most. Why can't companies make earbuds like Raycons with an actual, honest to god button?? These touch controls suck so much.
2.) The last minor gripe I have is that the noise cancelling is just OK. It's not much better turned on than off (and you'll save a lot of battery if it's off). But, when it is on, if you have long hair like me, I guess it brushes up against the mic or something, because every once in a while the earbuds will have a faint static sound in the background while in noise cancelling mode. It's really annoying, so I usually just have NC turned off.

In Summary:
Lots of cool features and good sound quality. Unfortunately, the touch controls are so annoying to use that they're unusable, and the noise cancelling is not good enough to justify the 1hr of battery you'll lose because of it."
jettero shannon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2023","One day I realized I lost my beloved Galaxy buds. I searched and searched for over two hours, but never found them. I continued to search on and off for several days, randomly lifting pillows, checking pockets of any new pants I put on, double-taking at acorns on bike rides. How I longed for my Galaxy buds!

My life moved on. My bike rides were lifeless. My Zoom meetings were embarrassing. I gave up... After three weeks, I ordered some cheap, poor-sounding alternatives to fill the void in my heart and resigned myself to them until I could stomach ordering a new pair of what I really wanted.

Well, wishes do come true. Just yesterday morning I was carrying my laundry down the stairs before stopping dead. I doubted what I had done. I felt my pockets. No keys. Monkeys! I locked myself out!

I walked a good sixteenth of a mile to the leasing office for my apartment complex to get their creepy master of the key to my home. On my walk back, I absentmindedly glanced down at the earth near one of the 150 parking spaces on my walk back and I kid you not, I saw a gray Galaxy bud sticking halfway out of the dirt. It was my bud!!!!!! I searched and searched and eventually found the second! righty!!!! No way they work, right? It's been three weeks. It's rained two times. There are nightly sprinklers here!

Nope. After a quick charge, they both work FLAWLESSLY. Now I just wish I begged God for world peace..."

Moonbeams,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2023","After losing my beloved Samsung Buds Plus, I went through a phase of mourning where I just listened to sad songs on my old, wired headphones. But eventually, I realized that life's too short to be tied down by cords, so I decided to give the Buds 2 a chance. And boy, am I glad I did! These babies are like the rebound relationship I never knew I needed. The fit is so perfect, it's like they were made for my ears (which, let's be real, are pretty weird-looking). And the sound? Let's just say I can finally hear all the intricate details of my favorite songs, like the subtle sound of a tambourine or the faint cry of my bank account begging for mercy. The comfort is also top-notch. I can wear them for hours on end without feeling like I'm getting a weird ear massage from an overeager robot. The only issue I have is that sometimes the touch control doesn't seem to understand my commands. But hey, nobody's perfect, right? Overall, I highly recommend the Samsung Buds 2 - they're like a hot new fling that you can't help but fall head over heels for."
Jared Lackey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023",As someone who came from using the Galaxy buds plus . So far I find these do have similar battery life and overall great performance and quality. I will say the additional featare absolutely amazing and I find that very helpful. I will say I miss some the inner clips from the Bud's plus that made the your buds feel more secure in the ear. Overall I would definitely recommend this product at the end of the day.

Brett,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2022","I've had these for 5 months now, and still really like them. I have used these doing yard work, traveling, and at sports events with no complaints. They have multiple ear cup options to help with fitment, and even have fitment testing in the app.

I also love that you can use each bud independently. You don't have to start the right ear and then the left. You can use the right one until it dies, throw it in the case to charge, and put the left one in to keep going.

If I have any issues I'll update but so far I love them.

UPDATE: Still love these earbuds, just wanted to add some real world. Took the fam to an indoor water park, and that is a bit much for these buds. They have to pipe in so much to counter the noise that you hear it, almost like white noise under your audio. No deal breaker for me, just thought I'd share."

Seattle Cooks,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","tldr; great buds *if* they stay in your ears - would recommend trying before you buy!
I have been wanting galaxy buds for a while now, finally got them but sadly had to return because I could not get them to stay in my ears. Despite using the fit testing feature they were falling out with minimal movement (eg standing from a chair). Otherwise these were much higher quality than my airpods in every other aspect; sound quality was great, they were very noise cancelling (though difficult to have a conversation even without the noise cancelling mode on), and the touch controlling feature were better."
busa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2022","I will start by saying I only bought these because I dropped my original galaxy buds and lost them. I LOVED the original buds. I wore them 8-10 hours a day every day. Even when Android 12 was released and the Bluetooth started acting weird I loved them. Even when using 1 ear bud at a time started not working properly I still loved them. Mainly because I believe it was the android update that broke them, not the buds breaking.

Fast forward to buying these. The fit is horrible. I have tried all 3 sizes. The large ones made my ear canal itch like crazy. The mediums allow the buds to turn and fit awkwardly and fall out. I didn't attempt the smalls for more than 5 mins.
I have seen many many people say they had to buy foam tips to make them fit right. The old buds hardly ever fell out unless I was doing a bent over exercise at the gym for a couple minutes.

The touch sensors are horrible. I don't know if it's because the fit is bad and I can't hit the right spot, but I have to tap them several times to get them to register that I touched them. Then on the other end they are way too sensitive to non human touch. I was wearing a rain jacket a week ago and the hood kept making the buds start and stop just by barely touching it, but as I said before, my hand barely registers when I touch them.

The sound quality is fine, the noise cancelling is fine, all the functional aspects of them are fine, but the fit is so terrible I don't even know how Samsung released them this way. The touch sensor is so inconsistent I almost wonder how they are the same brand as the originals.

I would not recommend buying these. I would honestly just buy the original buds if I had to go back and do it again."
