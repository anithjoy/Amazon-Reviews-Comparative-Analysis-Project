      "REVIEW:  At first I truly HATED these earbuds. I used the galaxy buds plus before them and believed they were superior in every single way. I would still repurchase a pair of those if these current ones do stop working but one of the earbuds went through a full washer and dryer cycle and still works just fine. It will be kind of glitchy when attempting to charge them in the case but the sound quality was not changed at all. One thing that is unforgivable in my opinion and was an issue from day one is the buds and the cases battery life. Its comical how fast they will be dying after using them for maybe a few hours\n",

Now I have these and I have to say I'm kinda upset that I waited so long. I let reviews about them not fitting well enough stop me from purchasing bc I will be working, out among other thing with them on. But I have them and they fit perfectly just like the first generation. I have tested out chewing and shaking my head with them and they haven't budged. If that changes I'll update.

      "REVIEW:  have gone through a lot of ear buds in hopes to find the perfect pair. The sound on these bad boys is amazing. It will literally drawn out other sounds. It also plays a sound when you have them in your ears which is another feature I like and have not seen. There is one issue that has been appearing in most of the ear buds above 50$, the battery is equal or less than 4 hours. I have tried to do different ways they say can make the battery last longer but most of those tricks are in lifetime, not in one use. However, if you make sure they are 100% charged before you use them, then you get a little more time. But I am able to put them into the box to charge for about 30 minutes and I can get 8 more hours to finish my shift at work. I like them a lot, just wish the battery was\n",

I've been using these for a few months now, upgraded from my previous galaxy buds and they work seamlessly with my Samsung Galaxy S23+. They paired immediately and easily and they connect WHENEVER I remove them from my ear. No connectivity issues, audio quality is awesome and they seam to cancel or allow exterior noise based on whatever setting I use pretty well.\n",

If I turn my head too far to one side or the other, they will disconnect as if taken out of my ear. This seamed to be a similar issue I had with my last ones but they weren't as sensitive.

However, not only could I not get them to fit snugly in my ears, I also encountered a plethora of small irritations that bothered me to the point of giving up on them. Here are some thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "The audio quality is far superior to the original Galaxy Buds. There is a lot more bass and the audio has more depth to it for sure. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't exactly describe the way these sound in proper terminology too well, but they sound awesome to me.\n",

      "Ambient sound mode is far and away better than the original Buds had. It is far easier to hear what is going on around you, and there are several levels of ambient sound so you can get exactly the amount of outside sound you need for your particular situation. It also doesn't have that faint hiss that the ambient sound mode on the original Galaxy Buds.\n",

      "-Let's start off with one of the major selling points of these earbuds. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is marketed as quieting your environment so you can hear whatever you're listening to more clearly without having to turn the volume all the way up. However, I found that the ANC on these earbuds doesn't actually do much. It didn't filter out voices, music, papers rustling, or most other common noises very effectively, and even the constant hum of an air purifier in my room nearby wasn't cut down by that much. Considering the 33% hit to battery life you're taking by using the ANC, I would expect it to work well, and it definitely doesn't. In fact, the original Galaxy Buds have better noise cancellation, simply because they fit in my ears better and thus provide a better seal for noise isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "-They would not fit in my ears properly, no matter which eartip sizes I tried. This is the most fundamental aspect of a pair of earbuds for obvious reasons; it doesn't matter how many incredible features they have if they don't fit correctly. Keep in mind that these do not have any wingtips like the original Galaxy Buds to keep them secure in your ears, so they have a much greater chance of falling out and getting lost. Every time I yawned, ate, or did any other kind of jaw movement, they would come loose in my ears, and I would have to grab the buds and push/twist them back into place. This introduced even more problems, as I will discuss in the next few points. It's also worth mentioning that the ANC is worthless when the earbuds are loose, as there is no seal, defeating one of the main reasons to buy these over the original Buds or the Buds+.\n",
      "\n",
      "-I'm not a big fan of the design of the Buds 2. They are very small, round and glossy, which means they are extremely difficult to grip compared to the original Galaxy Buds. The lack of wingtips makes this even worse, as I find myself gripping the wingtips when I'm putting in my Galaxy Buds or taking them out, and that feature is gone. Every major YouTuber seem to be fawning over the fact that these buds are smaller and lighter than previous iterations, but I don't see any meaningful increase in comfort from this design, and trying to grip these tiny things is incredibly frustrating. I was always worried I would drop them when trying to take them out of the case and put them in my ears. With the original Galaxy Buds, you had the wingtips, the touchpads on the ends, and matte-feeling plastic surfaces in the middle, so they were easy to grip when you wanted to put them in or remove them. The larger size didn't hurt, either. On the other hand though, these new Buds are a more unibody-like design, so it's not clear where the bud surface ends and the touchpad begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "-The touch areas are poorly defined. It seems like every time I actually want to use them, I can't get them to activate, and when I just want to adjust the buds in my ears, they trigger, pausing or skipping whatever I'm listening to or watching. It's not clear where the actual touch surface is, so accidental presses are constant, and since they didn't fit me well, I was constantly having to touch the earbuds to adjust them, meaning plenty of accidental touches were had. The original Galaxy Buds didn't have this problem at all, as the triangular touchpads were clearly defined and easy to feel out due to their smoother texture compared to the rest of the buds. It may just be me, but I even felt like the original touchpads were far more responsive to my touches compared to the ones on these. The frustration I experienced with these touchpads really made me realize how much I use the touchpads on my original Galaxy Buds, and how functional they were in comparison to these.\n",
      "\n",
      "-The case isn't as good as the original. They decided to have the cases for all colors be white, with the color of the specific buds in the middle. Why? Why do I have to have a white case? This may seem petty, but I would prefer a black case, or at least a darker color, and I don't get that option unless I shell out $20 more for a quality external protective case, which also adds bulk.\n",
      "-Something I did with the original Buds case was utilize it as a phone stand. Because of its wide pill shape, it is surprisingly well-suited to this purpose. However, it is impossible to use the Buds 2 case for this purpose for several reasons. First, the more square shape means that when the phone is in landscape mode, pressing the sides of the phone screen will make the whole thing collapse, which is annoying as ****. Secondly, the glossy finish makes it too slippery to be used for this purpose anyway.\n",
      "-Instead of going with a sleek matte finish like on the original case, Samsung decided to follow Apple and use a glossy finish on this new case, and I find it to be inferior for several reasons. One, fingerprint magnet. Two, it makes the case so slippery to hold that I'm afraid I'll drop the damn thing and lose my $150 earbuds when I'm out and about and trying to get them out. The matte finish on the original case didn't have either of these problems, it was grippable enough and didn't collect finger oil like a smartphone screen.\n",
      "-The square shape of this case means that charging it on a wireless charging stand is impossible. With the original, the pill shape meant it could be stood up on its short end and the Qi wireless charging coils would meet up, meaning it could be charged on wireless charging stands in addition to flat pads. This extra level of flexibility was awesome, and I used it to great effect many times. Not an option with this new case.\n",
      "-Petty complaint, but the snap when you close this new case is far inferior to that of the original case. Closing your earbud case with a satisfying snap after you're done using them is great, and it's not as much so here.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Eartips aren't that great. Not only did I have problems with the fit, but when I took the earbuds out of my ears, the tips would turn inside out half the time, which would require correction. I don't know if they're using inferior materials or what, but regardless, another minor annoyance I have to deal with a significant portion of the time when I want to stop using them.\n",
      "\n",
      "-No popup when opening the case and auto-pairing the buds. The Galaxy Buds and Buds+ show a card at the bottom of the phone screen displaying either the battery content of the buds (original buds) or the battery content of the buds and the case (buds+). For some reason, I never got a popup like this when I opened the case of the Buds 2. Why? It was nice to be able to see battery percentage upon opening the case without having to go into the app or create a dedicated widget on the home screen to monitor it. The Buds+ also have a nice animation of the buds flying out of the case and to their respective positions on the popup, a nice visual touch borrowed from Apple. It's possible that this needs to be enabled in the app somewhere, but I never had to do that with the original Galaxy Buds 2 I have, and I can't imagine Samsung would make the UX mistake of requiring a dig through the Wearable app to enable such a simple feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm terribly sorry if this review is overly long and nitpicky. I'm just interested in presenting every thought I had throughout the course of trying to like these earbuds in order to give you a more complete picture of what you might be able to expect if you buy these. They aren't bad by any means, but when you get annoyed a bit by this minor problem and a bit by that minor problem and so on, the nitpicks add up to significant frustration, and that made me quit even trying, sell these to my brother for $140, and go back to my original Galaxy Buds, which are tried and true. I am considering buying the Buds+ for my return to college instead, as they combine the tried-and-true design of the original Galaxy Buds with the best features of these new Buds 2, notably better audio quality and ambient sound mode. They also hold 11 hours of playback time in the buds alone, vs. 7.5 hours for the Buds 2 with ANC off, and 5 with it on. The case is also much better than the case for these new ones, and they are $50 cheaper to boot.\n",

      "REVIEW:  My experience with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 was decidedly negative for a couple of small reasons and one big reason. To begin with the positives, the noise cancellation worked decently well. I don't have much of a baseline because I had never owned a noise cancelling product before, but they did what they advertised - made noisy spaces quieter such that I could get work done in an office where people were talking and the bus wasn't so loud as to give me a headache. Sound quality was okay. The battery life wasn't great (again, very little for me to compare to) but the fact that they could recharge in the case was neat and made limitations on the buds' battery life manageable. Because having them in for many hours is uncomfortable anyway, they always got a break to recharge in the case and they always seated well in their little charging spots.\n",
      "\n",
      "That does bring up a point about comfort - namely, they weren't uncomfortable at first but became so after about an hour. Not surprising, especially given how they aspire to be low profile and, thus, are primarily hard shell that sits entirely inside one's ear, but it still must be said. Also they didn't stay in my ears particularly well with any of the cups they included. This became very irritating because pushing them back into my ears as they fell out would pause my music or skip tracks because as it triggered touch commands. The way to avoid this for me was to turn off touch commands with the app, but then I could only control the ear buds (pause, play, change noise cancellation setting) through my phone - which I couldn't do if I had the buds connected to another device (like my laptop, which was typical).\n",
      "\n",
      "More to the point - after a few (3-4) weeks of owning my Galaxy Buds, they broke. The sound in the left ear became very scratchy and got worse over time, sometimes cutting out almost entirely. I sought help on Samsung's site, since my product was very new and this is where the problems really began. Samsung's customer service is abysmal - probably the worst I've ever dealt with, and that puts them in competition with Cox Communications. There is no e-mail address for me to contact. The phone number on their website isn't helpful. The online chat forces you to go through an extremely unintelligent bot, which is frustrating. The interface when using the chat is occasionally opaque. The people I've been connected to are unhelpful and frequently difficult to communicate with, with less English competency on average than I would expect for such a customer-facing position. Eventually I was able to return the ear buds to be repaired. This took a week or two and they came back fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fix lasted for about one week and the left ear bud stopped working again. I was disappointed with the quality of the product I had bought and decided I would just return it. This is not possible through Samsung - you can only return things (within the warranty) to have them repaired! I tried to reason with the poor customer service tech who was obviously not authorized to do anything for me except initiate the repair process. Eventually I caved and accepted another repair. They did not initiate the process but *did* close the chat, forcing me to spend another 45 minutes going through the process again with someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so I sent them off again. After getting an e-mail informing me that my product would not be returned to me, then receiving another e-mail informing me that it would, I eventually got a NEW set of ear buds in the mail after about three weeks. These, too, failed in the same manner as the first after a month. I never did anything with the buds except put them in and take them out, I have no idea why they're so poorly made. I then spent the next several months, on and off, trying to return them. Every time I interacted with their customer service I had to walk away for a couple weeks so I didn't say something really mean to the poor useless idiot that was 'assisting' me this time. I had one guy tell me to \"hold on\" while he got some information, then kick me for inactivity. I had somebody tell me that they were going to transfer me to someone who could help and then close the chat - nothing ever popped up. I did manage to get one guy to set up a phone call with someone higher up on a Tuesday at 6PM. I waited for them to call but they never did - until noon the next day, when I picked up to a robocall telling me that I had reached Samsung customer service and that nobody was available to take my call. It then hung up. Which was rude. The most recent interaction I had was with a guy who was adamant that *he* couldn't do anything for me (including giving me the phone number or e-mail address of someone more useful), but that a local licensed Samsung service center could. Samsung's website has a map of authorized service centers near you! I went there while he stayed on the line and they told me that, in fact, they don't service ear buds and that the customer service tech was lying to me. I came back and duly informed Khaja K. of that development and he told me \"Let me transfer to order team to get it replacement\", followed by the familiar message telling me \"We are transferring your case to the appropriate team, a new chat window will open up in few seconds to message that team.\" Invariably, the chat closes and nothing else ever pops up. It does not even allow you to type anymore at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moral of this story is that the Galaxy Buds 2 are probably overpriced, but if you get a pair that isn't as flawed as mine were, they might be an okay product. However, if anything ever goes wrong, you've done your money. Godspeed. If I could give this product zero stars I would, because they haven't worked for more than a month at a time in the eight months or so I've owned them. I've returned them twice and, after probably five or six *more* interactions with customer service, neither I nor my ear buds have been served. It's actually miserable interacting with them. This concludes my review of both the product and the company that manufactures it.\n",

      "REVIEW:  I've been using an older set of Bose Headsets since sometime around 2014. It's the model that doesn't cover the ear, but it was always great a canceling noise, and the sound quality while watching movies on my tablet was great. The headset was wired, and it came with 2 batteries and a plug-in wall charging device. They were used, but high quality, noise canceling and when the ear muff pleather goes bad, you can replace them easily. It's been a tank for me, but they were bulky to pack when you're trying to travel lite with a carry-on and personal item. Additionally, I was ready for a wireless bluetooth solution. I will also preface that this is not my first attempt at noise canceling earbuds, I had purchased an \"Amazon\" off brand, on sale $49 set a couple of years back, and perhaps I didn't do something right when using them, but I just felt they plugged my ears, more so then it actually having a Noise Canceling feature (there's a difference, I'll get to that).\n",

      "I was getting ready for a New York trip where I needed to consolidate as much space as possible, because in this particular occasion I had a carry-on and a personal item. So, I ran across, a deal where the olive color SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 were going just shy of $99. Based off the reviews, it appeared to get the job done, albeit I was still a bit skeptical since the price was excellent, and I thought simply plugging the ear with a bud and filling it with music or sounds from a movie was good enough to call it noise canceling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result? I was pleasantly surprise how great these things were, there's a bit of trick to the ear buds when you don't have actual buttons to push, but it's a simple as holding your finger on the ear bud for a period of time turns on and off the noise canceling feature, and tapping the ear bud pauses it. And yes, I could tell the difference when I used the noise canceling feature, and it was freaking great in my opinion. I only used to watch a television series on my Amazon Fire Tablet, but it was fantastic, I have absolutely no complaints for the time I used it on the trip. Until I make a significantly longer trip (2 hrs for me to get to NY), I will not know how good the battery life is, or how long this product will last overall, but for $100, I highly recommend this product if you want a lean ear bud that noise cancels and sounds great watching movies and/or tv shows are your tablet.\n",

      "4) If I put my head in front of the fan I could hear a windy/buffeting sound just like any other buds. Just like when my lazy coworkers call me from the golf course and assign my extra duties. You know what I'm talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I could still hear the fan and the mower, but I was able to turn down the volume of my podcast quite a bit to hear clearly. I'm really attracted to the idea of listening at a lower volume to protect my hearing.\n",

The person(s) on the other end said the background noise on my side is not that bad so that area of noise cancelation is excellent. Noise cancelation on my side is incredible. The sound quality is fantastic. I listen to a lot of smooth jazz and the acoustics are excellent. The shape of the buds makes them difficult to remove. They're easily dropped when finally removed. The battery life is ok. I typically wear one unless on a call so I'm able to stretch my battery life. The battery for 1 earbud will be at 10 to 15% by 1130a if used constantly from 7a to 1130a. I assume they both would be dead if used together. Especially if the noise cancelation is on. The ambient noise filter is pretty cool. It would be better if closer sounds would be amplified. Using it, I can't hear a person that's talking right next to me very well. Overall, they're a great choice. I recommend.\n",

      "My earbuds had a sound quality issue that I'm hoping will get repaired. They're currently on the way to Samsung for repair. It started with my right ear buds max volume output being almost impossible to hear. You couldn't make out most words in videos or lower tones in songs. When this happened I also noticed that the buds would make a screeching sound if I had both buds in at the same time with either the noise cancelling or ambient noise setting on. This occurred even at 0 bluetooth volume. I then only used the left side for a few months before the same issue happened to it as well leaving me with unworkable ear buds and causing me to send them in. For those that are experiencing this issue I wish you luck resolving it as I've tried cleaning them and reinstalling the Samsung wearable app. This is not an issue with my other earbuds.

      "REVIEW:  I had and loved the samsung galaxy buds plus for around the two years I owned them, and the only reason that I purchased this model was because they got stolen, as I saw this model was a generation newer and was on sale for cheaper than the listings of the original samsung galaxy buds plus. This turned out to be one of the worst mistakes I made and I should have read more reviews than trusting that they couldn't mess up a pair of earbuds that badly when the first generation were very good (imo).\n",

      "However, in no way would I recommend buying these earbuds at all. Here are the negatives I noticed in under 4 months of somewhat frequent use:\n",
      "Firstly (and most importantly in my opinion), the in ear fit is absolute garbage. I tried using all three of the provided ear tips and with all of them if I so much as looked downwards, the earbuds would start to slip out of my ears. The original buds plus a rubber wing of sorts on them to help the earbuds stay in your ear, but it seems like for some reason they chose to make the design look more aesthetically pleasing, leading to there being nothing except the silicon ear tip to help it stay in your ear. I tried to place the earbuds in every orientation in my ears, attempting to brace the earbuds somewhere to keep them from falling out of my ears to no avail. Keep in mind this happened through simple movements like lowering my head to chop vegetables in the kitchen or just simply walking forwards, it would only take under a couple of minutes for me to have to readjust the earbuds in my ears to keep them from falling out.\n",
      "This readjusting would then lead to it pausing whatever I was listening to since they must have increased the touch sensitivity for these earbuds, because it would register a touch even if I touched the earbuds with my shoulder even when I was wearing a sweatshirt. I'm not including this as a distinct negative I noticed, as some people might appreciate the increased touch sensitivity, as it can even register touches when wearing gloves in my experience, but in combination with having to readjust the earbuds every couple of minutes from them slipping out of my ears it did become an annoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the reliability/durability of the earbuds is also garbage. Within 3 months of use, the left earbud flat out stopped working, I was doing some work in a workshop (cutting wood and metal) and I heard some static coming from the left earbud before it stopped outputting volume entirely. With only an IPX2 rating for dust/water protection maybe some sawdust or metal particles got in the earbud and shorted something out, but it wasn't a ridiculous amount of particles I was spraying everywhere, so for it to fail within 3 months of purchase is just unacceptable for earbuds which are supposed to be for daily use.\n",
      "I tried updating the samsung app, using it with three other devices, and making sure that both the earbuds and the case were fully recharged, nothing fixed the left earbud, which is even more disappointing because that was the one that fit slightly better in my ear (only requiring readjusting every 5-10 minutes as opposed to around 3-5 minutes on the right ones).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, the case is very annoying, as any time you drop the case, it opens, sending the earbuds flying out across the floor. This might have been a personal problem, as I usually kept the case in my pocket along with my keys, but occasionally when I would pull out my keys the case would come tumbling out along with them, leading to me having to search the surrounding floor for where the headphones had flown off to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion do not buy, the sound quality is good and the ANC is fine (albeit not great since the in-ear fit doesn't fully isolate incoming sound), but the in ear fit and durability of these make them utterly unusable for even the simplest tasks much less something like use in exercising where the earbuds will fall out even more.\n",

      "REVIEW:  I'm upgrading from a three year old cheep pair of earbuds. I went from 30 minutes of battery life to 5 hours on one charge. The sound quality is good but nothing special. I do like that you have several equalizer settings on the app. I could barely tell the difference between the ANC on or off. It has the hardware for ANC but it isn't good. The majority of the noise cancelation comes from simply having the headphones on. I have a seven year old pair of Bose QuietComfort 20 and you can easily tell when ANC is on or off. I haven't really used the ambient sound setting but it seems ok. The fit is good but they do shift out a little when I move my face muscles, like smiling or yawning. Regardless of the shifting, they haven't fallen out at all. Honestly I feel like the only noticeable differences between these and my old buds is the battery life and Bluetooth range. Overall they are unremarkable. I'm sure you could find a comparable quality pair of buds for half the price. I got mine used, so they cost half the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update. It's been several months since my original review. Running with them is ok but I usually turn off the touch controls since I have to constantly have to keep pushing them back in. The touch functions can be too sensitive at times, especially when all you're trying to do is push them back in. I always try to just touch the top and bottom but somehow I still touch the middle. Using them for calls or while eating will cause them to slowly push out of your ear so I constantly have to push them back in. I've accidently hung up on people several time because of this. I tried using the Labs edge tap for volume, It sucks. If I'm talking or eating it will chance the volume randomly. I'm aware that it is caused by my ear touching the sides while I'm chewing or talking but it's still sucks. Going back to the ANC, It does work in certain situations. It works ok for the train but not a mower in the distance. It can muffle a fan but not a vacuum.\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, now some really annoying things which makes me give them 3 stars instead of 5:\n",
      "1.) THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. If you have the app, you can change what the taps do, what the sensitivity is, and if you want them to be off or on. I have recently just been keeping them turned off all the time. I love being able to tap my earbuds to pause, long hold to change the volume, etc. However, these stupid earbuds have touch sensitivity instead of actual buttons, which means if you want to adjust your ear buds or take one out to listen to someone or whatever, you will pause your music/podcast/whatever about 75% of the time. Even if you're really careful just to grab the slim, slick edges. And what REALLY irks me is when you're outside and sweaty and your HAIR touches the darn thing, changing songs, blowing your eardrums out by increasing the volume, pausing your media, skipping to the next track UGH. It makes the touch controls completely useless when you are exercising, which is when I want them the most. Why can't companies make earbuds like Raycons with an actual, honest to god button?? These touch controls suck so much.\n",
      "2.) The last minor gripe I have is that the noise cancelling is just OK. It's not much better turned on than off (and you'll save a lot of battery if it's off). But, when it is on, if you have long hair like me, I guess it brushes up against the mic or something, because every once in a while the earbuds will have a faint static sound in the background while in noise cancelling mode. It's really annoying, so I usually just have NC turned off.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Summary:\n",
      "Lots of cool features and good sound quality. Unfortunately, the touch controls are so annoying to use that they're unusable, and the noise cancelling is not good enough to justify the 1hr of battery you'll lose because of it.\n",

Even when Android 12 was released and the Bluetooth started acting weird I loved them. Even when using 1 ear bud at a time started not working properly I still loved them. Mainly because I believe it was the android update that broke them, not the buds breaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to buying these. The fit is horrible. I have tried all 3 sizes. The large ones made my ear canal itch like crazy. The mediums allow the buds to turn and fit awkwardly and fall out. I didn't attempt the smalls for more than 5 mins.\n",
      "I have seen many many people say they had to buy foam tips to make them fit right. The old buds hardly ever fell out unless I was doing a bent over exercise at the gym for a couple minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The touch sensors are horrible. I don't know if it's because the fit is bad and I can't hit the right spot, but I have to tap them several times to get them to register that I touched them. Then on the other end they are way too sensitive to non human touch. I was wearing a rain jacket a week ago and the hood kept making the buds start and stop just by barely touching it, but as I said before, my hand barely registers when I touch them.\n",

      "The sound quality is fine, the noise cancelling is fine, all the functional aspects of them are fine, but the fit is so terrible I don't even know how Samsung released them this way. The touch sensor is so inconsistent I almost wonder how they are the same brand as the originals.\n",

      "REVIEW:  Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's \"universal\" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.\n",
      "\n",
      "AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "AppleCare tips:\n",
      "You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using AirPods with Android:\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find \"AirPods\" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAIR WARNING:\n",
      "\n",
      "You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called \"AirPopUp\". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.\n",

      "Sound Quality (4/5):\n",
      "The sound quality of these earbuds is generally good. They deliver clear and well-balanced audio, making them suitable for a wide range of music genres and audio content. However, some audiophiles may find that they lack the depth and richness found in higher-end headphones.\n",

      "Battery Life (4/5):\n",
      "The included Lightning charging case offers an additional 24 hours of battery life, making it easy to keep the earbuds powered up throughout the day. While this is a decent battery life, there are other models on the market that offer even longer playtime.\n",

      "Charging (4/5):\n",
      "The Lightning connector is both a pro and a con. It's convenient if you already own Apple devices, but it's limiting if you use other devices with different charging ports. It would be great to have USB-C compatibility for broader appeal.\n",

      "Voice Assistant Integration (5/5):\n",
      "The AirPods have excellent voice assistant integration with Siri, making it effortless to control your music, check the weather, or send messages with just your voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Price (3/5):\n",

They are comfortable for daily use and come with a convenient charging case. However, the price may deter budget-conscious shoppers, and the Lightning connector might be inconvenient for non-Apple users.

No matter how many earpieces I use, they always manage to pop out of my ears at the worst possible time. Try finding your earbud that fell on to the floor of a packed subway car. Not fun. I have the generation 2 as well as the generation 2 pro. Generation 2 Pro wins hands down but it is pricey. For the average user, who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, gen 2 is just fine. But, be warn, there are limited functions by touch. There is stop/play/forward/rewind. The noise cancellation is above average. The sound quality is also above average. When using it on calls, the sound is clear and crisp. If you have an iPhone, it pairs automatically. On rare occasions, the airpods become disconnected and I have to manually pair them again. I don't know why this happens. But, it is something you should be aware of. Overall, I think it is an above average wireless airpods.\n",

This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's \"universal\" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.\n",
      "\n",
      "AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "AppleCare tips:\n",
      "You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using AirPods with Android:\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find \"AirPods\" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAIR WARNING:\n",
      "\n",
      "You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called \"AirPopUp\". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.\n",

      "REVIEW:  Let's first start off with noise cancellation: It's non-existent. You WILL hear everything going on around you, with turning the volume up just damaging your ears. This is due to the AirPod kind of laying inside your ear, which doesn't create a seal as in earbuds with silicone tips. This not only kills any noise cancellation, but will cause sound to bleed to the outside when loud enough (say around 50%).\n",
      "\n",
      "The issues above are also benefits in environments like offices or schools. This is thanks to the lack of noise cancellation. With music playing, talking to someone sounds just the same as without them. In addition, without a seal being created in your ear, they have to be louder than usual, which they certainly are (Not by a huge margin, but a noticeable one). Now for the stem of the AirPods, they aren't just for show. The microphones in the stem help make calls sound clear and usable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shape of the AirPods are a hit-or-miss. They'll either fit you or they won't. The best way you could test this is by trying on some EarPods, as they are pretty much AirPods with wires (design-wise). For me, they fit my ears, but start to slip off on their own. They don't fall, but they give me the sensation that they will. You can fix this with some rubber hooks that go on the AirPods to hold them in place inside your ears (You'll need to remove them when putting them back in their case though).\n",
      "\n",
      "The battery life is...fine. It's not abysmal and will last you a good while, but it's not anything to write home about. At least the pop-up when opening the case will remind you of charging them (On an iPhone, I don't think it'll do this on Android). It charges via lightning, but there is a version available with a wireless charging case if you'd like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound quality is good, but not perfect. Bass is not it's strong point, and some instruments do get muffled out on some tracks. Vocals can be heard well (which helps out on calls) though. Disclaimer: I'm not an audiophile, just a guy that listens to music for hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial pairing is relatively simple on an iPhone/Mac, just open them while being close to your intended device. The AirPods connect nearly instant when taking them out of the case. While I can't speak for Android or Windows devices, I would assume that they would pair the same way as any other devices, but don't take my word for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there is no official water/sweat resistance to them. I haven't used them in these environments, but have heard stories of them surviving washing machines (Which I will not be testing). Take that with a grain of salt though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, they are great earphones for me, but make sure you know what you need of your earphones first. If you make a lot of calls and want to hear everything around you, these are the ones to go for.\n",

The sound is great and easy to hear. Remembering to turn iPad and iPhone volume down is a must because when a call comes in, it's so loud and will shock you while you're working on something else. I like it because you can accept or decline the call. If you decline the call, you can continue working and if you accept, you can continue your work after the call. I set up with 3 months free for music on Amazon. I don't usually do this, but I want to use them while listening to music when doing the dishwasher, since I am the dish washer. Smile!

I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.\n",

      "But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.\n",
      "I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.\n",
      "I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.\n",
      "I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.\n",

      "REVIEW:  Let me start by saying that given the price, I didn't actually have high expectations for these. I'm pleased to say that I was pleasantly surprised. They definitely live to Apples quality that we've come to except from their products. The sound in my opinion is excellent and all of the features such as pause, next track and prior track work effortlessly with 2 taps. Paring was a breeze and instant. So far the battery life is decent. That said, I have noticed that the actual case loses its charge a bit faster then the pods themselves but its nothing extreme. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. They also came quickly. I ordered them on a Tues. night and had them by Thurs. afternoon. For those who are concerned about receiving fakes, they are NOT fake. For over 2 months prior to purchasing these I did sooooo much reading and spent all day Thurs putting them to the test according to what Apple suggests for comparing real vs fake, and then some. Geez, who knew that there are so many ways to check for the authenticity of these. Trust me when I say I did everything! I would caution you not to go my the serial number alone. Sadly the scammers are finding ways around that now according to almost ever article I read including Apple. Perhaps the easiest way to is to check on your \" find my\" app. Apparently the knock offs won't show up on that app. And that's straight from Apple. The second best way I found was, with you ipods connected, go to settings > general > About & scroll down until you see Carrier Lock, just under that you should be able to see your name and airpods. Click on that and then you should be able to see manufacturer, model #, serial #, firmware version and hardware version. If thats missing they're fake. I know that info is also on another part of the phone but thats where you need to see it. According to Apple that information along with \"find my\" are the 2 thing that scammers have yet been able to get around. So with all of that said if you're considering the purchase from here I would say do it. It's a great price and it's not a 3party seller. You can always check it out yourself after receiving them and if need be send them back. And for what its worth, I actually have a pair Beats Wireless earbuds and I personally think these ipods sound much better. I hope this helps. Happy listening.\n",

      "REVIEW:  I like the fact that they fit perfect in my ear without me having to keep pushing them in. I bought the AirPod 3 first and they was hurting me so bad I had to keep jamming them in my ear to even hear. Gave them to my daughter. I got these, the 2s and these are great. I’ve had them in all day and have been dancing around and playing with the kids and they are still in my ear. I had forgot that they were which is scary bc I can easily lose them. When I purchased these they arrived half charged and the charging cord and case didn’t work at all so I had to send back and wait two days for the replacement pair. When I got the second pair, the cord didn’t work again however I had a few around the house to use. I couldn’t tell if the case was charging bc this model has no charging indicator unless it’s the light when you open the case. Anyhow, the only way that I was able to see if the case was charging was either one or both of the pods have to be inside the case. If both are in my ear I wouldn’t be able to see if it was charging so I would think that the case was broke and defective. I finally put both pods back in and the case showed up on my phone indicating that it was charging. I took one pod out and was still able to see it charging. When I took both buds out I could not tell if the case was even charging at all until I waited about 30 minutes put both pods back in then the indicator showed back up on my phone on full percent almost. That’s going to be annoying. So far so good on the battery life. I just got them today and have had them in since like 1:00. And they are not dead although I just had them in my ear while doing homework. Not listening to anything. The sound quality kind of sucks which I needed the noise cancellation due to me working at Amazon where it is very loud. It’s clear and good for anywhere besides a loud environment. I have not tried them at work yet but I had a knockoff brand that were louder than these so I know I’ll still have issues with the sound on these. I’ll get the pros for better sound later and give these ones to my son. Overall, I’m satisfied and I’m happy that I have these. Hopefully they perform well and lasts a while. I’ve heard others having there’s for more than three years. I recommend these if you have issues with ear comfort with other ones. These are comfortable. Love them\n",
      "Update… I did not like them after a couple days. They did start falling out with my oily ears. They wouldn’t stay in. I ordered the 2 generation pros and I’m Inlove and boy are they loud. Spend a few extra dollars and get the pros for better ear support and comfort. I’m never going back to anything else. My last review\n",

I have smaller ears so I figured they wouldn't stay in my ears right or they would hurt. I've always been a user of the Skullcandy wireless earbuds but now they're getting to the point where they are $60, $70, or $80 there really isn't that big of a deal in spending a little bit more.

The wireless connection is rock solid, and the sound quality is fantastic. Whether I'm listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the audio is clear and crisp, with just the right amount of bass.\n",

      "The convenience of the wireless design cannot be overstated. It's liberating to move around without any cords getting in the way, and the AirPods stay comfortably in my ears, even during workouts. The lightning charging case is a great addition – it keeps my AirPods protected and provides multiple charges on the go. Setup was a breeze; they connected seamlessly to my iPhone as soon as I opened the case.\n",

      "The touch controls are intuitive and responsive. I can pause/play, skip tracks, and even activate Siri with a simple tap. Speaking of Siri, the voice recognition is surprisingly accurate, making it easy to make calls and send messages hands-free.\n",

      "Battery life is solid; I can easily get through a day of use without needing to recharge the case. The seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem is a huge plus – I can switch between devices effortlessly, and the automatic pausing when I remove an AirPod is a small but brilliant feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they might seem a bit pricey, the Apple AirPods 2nd Generation are worth every penny for the audio quality, convenience, and overall user experience they provide. If you're looking for top-notch wireless earbuds, these are definitely worth considering!\n",

There is also battery percentage monitoring from your iPhone, which is really helpful to maintain them. The sound is overall better also and they are comfortable to use for long periods of time.

He wears these during his school days & then after during his 4-6 hour workday & can go a couple days without charging them. These come with a charging cord but no block. When I do charge them the charge to 100% is fast. For $99 these are well worth it. I purchased the Apple Care+ coverage in case these go bad & that was well worth the cost.

Then again we are a society that has to have the newest most expensive thing because we need to keep up with Mr. and Mrs. Jones, right? So I guess if that’s your thing, go ahead and buy the new generation, but these are much better and more comfortable so I will stick with the older generations. I’ve never been one to have to keep up with the crowd. I hate contributing to the over market of happening to buy the brand. New iPhone is brand new earbuds and happening to keep out dating of things every year and make things insufficient. It only contributes to the increase of the landfills so I’m gonna give props to every single person who purchases an older generation and refurbished items. And if you buy it, just because you are on a frugal and or frugal budget or you’re a broke person and just want an earbud that is good quality I will give props to you too, because without knowing it you are purchasing something that is not going with the flow of society\n",
