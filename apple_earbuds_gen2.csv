renee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023","Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.

Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.

Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.

Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.

Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.

AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.

AppleCare tips:
You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.

You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.

You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.

Using AirPods with Android:

Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.

If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.

FAIR WARNING:

You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.

I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.

For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.

Galaxy Buds features:
Made by Samsung
Audio powered by AKG
Rubber ear bud tips
Pair with Samsung device to get the most
Wireless charging case
Active noise cancellation
Comes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)
Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.

I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.

Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
Mariana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023","I love the 2nd generation Airpods, more than the most recent models, this is basically due to the comfort they offer, they are really comfortable when placed in the ears.

What do I like about these airpods?:
- The physical ergonomics of the product are very comfortable in the ear, it does not fall out or hurt as the hours go by.
- The connectivity between the airpod and the iPhone is almost perfect, it almost always works very well and pairs well, although there are times when only one earbud can be heard but it is solved by putting them back in their case, sometimes it can be a little annoying but it is done. I hold on.
- The audio quality is very good, it sounds really good.
- The quality of the microphone when I am on calls with other people is very good, the person I am talking to always hears me very well and without interference or strange sounds.
- You can buy the case you want to protect them.
- Quick compatibility with the iPad.
- Obviously it does not have noise cancellation, but for that I have another full headset product, I use these airpods while I pay attention to what is happening in the environment, I would not like to be isolated, and above all it sounds good and for calls it is excellent."
John,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023","The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a popular choice for wireless earbuds, and they come with a Lightning charging case that offers a convenient way to charge and store them. Here's a detailed review based on my experience:

Sound Quality (4/5):
The sound quality of these earbuds is generally good. They deliver clear and well-balanced audio, making them suitable for a wide range of music genres and audio content. However, some audiophiles may find that they lack the depth and richness found in higher-end headphones.

Wireless Connectivity (5/5):
Apple has always excelled in creating seamless wireless connections, and the AirPods are no exception. The pairing process is incredibly easy, and they seamlessly connect to your Apple devices via Bluetooth. The connection remains stable, and you can switch between devices effortlessly.

Comfort and Fit (4/5):
The AirPods are designed to be comfortable for extended use. They're lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. However, some users might find them a bit loose during intense physical activities or while running.

Battery Life (4/5):
The included Lightning charging case offers an additional 24 hours of battery life, making it easy to keep the earbuds powered up throughout the day. While this is a decent battery life, there are other models on the market that offer even longer playtime.

Charging (4/5):
The Lightning connector is both a pro and a con. It's convenient if you already own Apple devices, but it's limiting if you use other devices with different charging ports. It would be great to have USB-C compatibility for broader appeal.

Voice Assistant Integration (5/5):
The AirPods have excellent voice assistant integration with Siri, making it effortless to control your music, check the weather, or send messages with just your voice.

Price (3/5):
The AirPods are on the higher end of the price range for wireless earbuds. While they offer a great experience, some users might find more affordable options with similar features from other brands.

Overall (4/5):
The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a solid choice for those in the Apple ecosystem who want reliable wireless earbuds with seamless connectivity and good sound quality. They are comfortable for daily use and come with a convenient charging case. However, the price may deter budget-conscious shoppers, and the Lightning connector might be inconvenient for non-Apple users. If you're willing to invest in quality wireless earbuds and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, these are a great pick."
W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023","I love Apple products. Why? Because they are simple and work great. I've used generic earbuds before and they use to annoy the hell out of me. No matter how many earpieces I use, they always manage to pop out of my ears at the worst possible time. Try finding your earbud that fell on to the floor of a packed subway car. Not fun. I have the generation 2 as well as the generation 2 pro. Generation 2 Pro wins hands down but it is pricey. For the average user, who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, gen 2 is just fine. But, be warn, there are limited functions by touch. There is stop/play/forward/rewind. The noise cancellation is above average. The sound quality is also above average. When using it on calls, the sound is clear and crisp. If you have an iPhone, it pairs automatically. On rare occasions, the airpods become disconnected and I have to manually pair them again. I don't know why this happens. But, it is something you should be aware of. Overall, I think it is an above average wireless airpods."

Jesus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023","Let's first start off with noise cancellation: It's non-existent. You WILL hear everything going on around you, with turning the volume up just damaging your ears. This is due to the AirPod kind of laying inside your ear, which doesn't create a seal as in earbuds with silicone tips. This not only kills any noise cancellation, but will cause sound to bleed to the outside when loud enough (say around 50%).

The issues above are also benefits in environments like offices or schools. This is thanks to the lack of noise cancellation. With music playing, talking to someone sounds just the same as without them. In addition, without a seal being created in your ear, they have to be louder than usual, which they certainly are (Not by a huge margin, but a noticeable one). Now for the stem of the AirPods, they aren't just for show. The microphones in the stem help make calls sound clear and usable.

The shape of the AirPods are a hit-or-miss. They'll either fit you or they won't. The best way you could test this is by trying on some EarPods, as they are pretty much AirPods with wires (design-wise). For me, they fit my ears, but start to slip off on their own. They don't fall, but they give me the sensation that they will. You can fix this with some rubber hooks that go on the AirPods to hold them in place inside your ears (You'll need to remove them when putting them back in their case though).

The battery life is...fine. It's not abysmal and will last you a good while, but it's not anything to write home about. At least the pop-up when opening the case will remind you of charging them (On an iPhone, I don't think it'll do this on Android). It charges via lightning, but there is a version available with a wireless charging case if you'd like.

Sound quality is good, but not perfect. Bass is not it's strong point, and some instruments do get muffled out on some tracks. Vocals can be heard well (which helps out on calls) though. Disclaimer: I'm not an audiophile, just a guy that listens to music for hours.

Initial pairing is relatively simple on an iPhone/Mac, just open them while being close to your intended device. The AirPods connect nearly instant when taking them out of the case. While I can't speak for Android or Windows devices, I would assume that they would pair the same way as any other devices, but don't take my word for it.

Also, there is no official water/sweat resistance to them. I haven't used them in these environments, but have heard stories of them surviving washing machines (Which I will not be testing). Take that with a grain of salt though.

Overall, they are great earphones for me, but make sure you know what you need of your earphones first. If you make a lot of calls and want to hear everything around you, these are the ones to go for."

Jodi B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023",Hands down the most solid earpods available. not recommended but mine survived a wash/dry cycle 2x. naysayers remark they are easy to lose. i disagree based on my experience and usage (daily). i like the 2nd generation best and just bought a pair for a holiday gift. great price & excellent quality and durability. sound quality is also amazing and its easy to connect to use for voice calls/text with your cell phone. don’t hesitate to get these !
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023",Can’t believe it took me this long to try Air Pods. They sound EXCELLENT. Easy to use. Super comfy. My only qualm is the lid of the case feels like it will 100% break one day if it catches anything in motion so just be careful. Really do love these headphones though.
Boxman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","I’ve never used an apple airpod prior to 2023 but so far its been a good experience. I use this casually and at work. The airpods do have some difficulty staying on my ear at first but the problem goes away after my ears get used to the shape. There are some touch control things in the pod itself, but its just play, pause, restart/back a track, and vice versa.

This airpod doesn’t have noise cancellation, its got no silicone tips to enclose your ear. Because of that, its very good in environments where you still need to hear and want to listen to music (unless you max out the volume).

At the time of this writing, I’ve used my new airpods for about three weeks. I usually use one pod at a time and leave it on till it dies. They last me about 8 hrs on a full charge."
Faith Hope,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023","I like the air pods. They worked as advertised. They are comfortable and when shaking my head they don't fall out of my ear. I used then with iPhone and iPad. The sound is great and easy to hear. Remembering to turn iPad and iPhone volume down is a must because when a call comes in, it's so loud and will shock you while you're working on something else. I like it because you can accept or decline the call. If you decline the call, you can continue working and if you accept, you can continue your work after the call. I set up with 3 months free for music on Amazon. I don't usually do this, but I want to use them while listening to music when doing the dishwasher, since I am the dish washer. Smile! My kitchen is very small and gets very warm. So I may add to this review later."
Kimberly3706,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023","I was so excited to get these on Amazon day! The price was too good to pass up and my son had these exact ones so I knew they would be great since I tried his out and they were! Easy to pair with your phone, great sound, doesn't fall out of your ears when walking or bending. Overall a great wireless ear bud and cheaper than BJ's!"
Howard Owens,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023","Before I spent the money on these, I started out with a cheap imitation and found I was OK with AirPods. So I bought the real thing and think they're great. The difference in sound quality between the two pairs is notable. Apple products are always better than imitators."
MH20,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023","I finally got these! Thank you Amazon Deal Days! I really like the features that integrate with my iPhone, like Siri availability, Notifications delivered quietly with a little info (so you know if you need to deal with it now or not), tap controls you can customize, good sound for listening to anything and phone calls for hands free movement. I had a friend say the sound on a call was in and out a couple times at when I first got them (she’s in Canada), but they seem to have settled in nicely on every call, and no complaints since. I can’t hear what’s going on around me much while listening to music, etc. If doing exercise, would get a gadget to make sure they didn’t fall out. Very pleased overall!"
Kat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023","I use these all day and literally almost all night! Either the case is always charged to 100% or the airpods are, so I'm able to use them all day long. I also sleep with them in so I can listen to my overnight meditations. Most of the time, they seem to make it through 3/4s of the night before the charge dies. And the thing I really love about them, which is different than lesser quality airpods, is that they connect via bluetooth almost instantly, as soon as I put them in my ears. I found with cheaper quality airpods, it was always a struggle to get them to connect to my iphone."
TxKat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023","Love these so much better than the Pros. These fit wonderfully into my ear. I work out with them, run, and just clean around the house. I've never had an issue with these bouncing out as I work out. The battery life is great. I can wear them at work for a full 8 hours."
steadyt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023","The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) have been a total game-changer for my daily life! As a long-time Apple user, I finally decided to invest in these wireless earbuds, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

First and foremost, the convenience they offer is unparalleled. The seamless pairing process with my iPhone was effortless, and they automatically connect as soon as I place them in my ears. I love the way the music automatically pauses when I remove one AirPod, and resumes as soon as I put it back in. It's such a small detail, but it makes a world of difference in my listening experience.

The sound quality of these AirPods is fantastic. The audio is clear, crisp, and surprisingly rich, even in bass-heavy tracks. I'm genuinely impressed by how well they deliver music, podcasts, and calls, providing an immersive experience whether I'm working out or simply commuting.

The wireless design is another aspect that I adore. The freedom of not having to deal with tangled wires or constantly readjusting earbuds during a workout is liberating. They fit comfortably and securely in my ears, even during intense activities, and I've never experienced any discomfort.

The battery life is excellent as well. With the included charging case, I can easily extend the playtime throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. The case itself charges quickly, making it ready for use whenever I need it.

As someone who frequently uses Siri on my iPhone, the seamless integration with these AirPods is a huge plus. The hands-free access to Siri is incredibly convenient for changing tracks, adjusting volume, or simply answering calls without reaching for my phone.

I also appreciate the lightning charging feature. It aligns perfectly with my other Apple devices, and it's one less cable to worry about when traveling or charging on the go.

One minor downside is that the AirPods are relatively expensive compared to other wireless earbuds on the market. However, the quality, performance, and user experience justify the investment for me.

In conclusion, the Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) have exceeded my expectations in every way. The seamless connectivity, top-notch sound quality, comfortable fit, and convenient features make them an indispensable accessory for any Apple user. While they may be on the pricier side, I believe they are worth every penny for the unmatched experience they provide. I highly recommend these wireless earbuds to anyone looking for a superior listening experience and ultimate convenience on a daily basis!"
Snow Cat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2023","I bought them on prime day for a deal, but the price went down again recently. I reached out to customer service, and they were very nice to provide a price match and refunded to my prime membership charge credit card!"
Santiago Penafiel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2023","super easy to connect, they fell multiple times (concrete, snow) and still work perfectly.

Ilovemymac,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020","I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.

Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.
I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.

I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.

First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.
But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.
I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.
I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.
I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.

So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone."

I have no idea why, but I purchased these and I can’t say wow, enough!! I have small ears and they fit fine because of the contour. Love the case, magnetic so they don’t fall out, charge quickly. I haven’t paid attention to the longevity of time allowance, but I believe it stated four hours? I just keep my case with me and have adapters everywhere I go anyway so I never run into a problem. The sound is so magnificent. It’s better than any earbud I’ve ever used. The sound is clear, earbuds are durable."
Cindrela,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023","like them better than the Airpods Pro, exactly because the 'airtightness' of the 'Pros', including the noise cancellation - felt uncomfortable. I was happy to find them at excellent price!"

ACS413,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023","I bought these because I was told that they deliver great sound and they fit comfortably in smaller ears, and I guess that was true!

The sound, especially the bass, is very clear. A full charge can last a long time, but that just depends on how often you use it.

They also fit my smaller ears comfortably without straining them and they don't fall out, no matter what I'm doing.

I had a brief problem with the sound dropping from the right ear bud, but I used the Amazon tech walk-through and I have not had the problem since.

Definitely worth the price for me!"
susan rosenberg,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023","Ignore my previous review. My charging cable had died and I didn't realize it. The only complaint I have about these pods is they make my ears a bit itchy where they contact my skin. I read up on cleaning them and will try that and rewrite this review if that works.
Also want to say that Apple gave me 6 months of music for free - so when all is said and done, the cost of these pods is quite nominal. I know this is not a review of Apple music, and I've yet to compare it to other streaming services, but I don't think I will keep this service."

Espresso Lover!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023","Let me start by saying that given the price, I didn't actually have high expectations for these. I'm pleased to say that I was pleasantly surprised. They definitely live to Apples quality that we've come to except from their products. The sound in my opinion is excellent and all of the features such as pause, next track and prior track work effortlessly with 2 taps. Paring was a breeze and instant. So far the battery life is decent. That said, I have noticed that the actual case loses its charge a bit faster then the pods themselves but its nothing extreme. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase. They also came quickly. I ordered them on a Tues. night and had them by Thurs. afternoon. For those who are concerned about receiving fakes, they are NOT fake. For over 2 months prior to purchasing these I did sooooo much reading and spent all day Thurs putting them to the test according to what Apple suggests for comparing real vs fake, and then some. Geez, who knew that there are so many ways to check for the authenticity of these. Trust me when I say I did everything! I would caution you not to go my the serial number alone. Sadly the scammers are finding ways around that now according to almost ever article I read including Apple. Perhaps the easiest way to is to check on your "" find my"" app. Apparently the knock offs won't show up on that app. And that's straight from Apple. The second best way I found was, with you ipods connected, go to settings > general > About & scroll down until you see Carrier Lock, just under that you should be able to see your name and airpods. Click on that and then you should be able to see manufacturer, model #, serial #, firmware version and hardware version. If thats missing they're fake. I know that info is also on another part of the phone but thats where you need to see it. According to Apple that information along with ""find my"" are the 2 thing that scammers have yet been able to get around. So with all of that said if you're considering the purchase from here I would say do it. It's a great price and it's not a 3party seller. You can always check it out yourself after receiving them and if need be send them back. And for what its worth, I actually have a pair Beats Wireless earbuds and I personally think these ipods sound much better. I hope this helps. Happy listening."
Plain Jane,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2023","I like the fact that they fit perfect in my ear without me having to keep pushing them in. I bought the AirPod 3 first and they was hurting me so bad I had to keep jamming them in my ear to even hear. Gave them to my daughter. I got these, the 2s and these are great. I’ve had them in all day and have been dancing around and playing with the kids and they are still in my ear. I had forgot that they were which is scary bc I can easily lose them. When I purchased these they arrived half charged and the charging cord and case didn’t work at all so I had to send back and wait two days for the replacement pair. When I got the second pair, the cord didn’t work again however I had a few around the house to use. I couldn’t tell if the case was charging bc this model has no charging indicator unless it’s the light when you open the case. Anyhow, the only way that I was able to see if the case was charging was either one or both of the pods have to be inside the case. If both are in my ear I wouldn’t be able to see if it was charging so I would think that the case was broke and defective. I finally put both pods back in and the case showed up on my phone indicating that it was charging. I took one pod out and was still able to see it charging. When I took both buds out I could not tell if the case was even charging at all until I waited about 30 minutes put both pods back in then the indicator showed back up on my phone on full percent almost. That’s going to be annoying. So far so good on the battery life. I just got them today and have had them in since like 1:00. And they are not dead although I just had them in my ear while doing homework. Not listening to anything. The sound quality kind of sucks which I needed the noise cancellation due to me working at Amazon where it is very loud. It’s clear and good for anywhere besides a loud environment. I have not tried them at work yet but I had a knockoff brand that were louder than these so I know I’ll still have issues with the sound on these. I’ll get the pros for better sound later and give these ones to my son. Overall, I’m satisfied and I’m happy that I have these. Hopefully they perform well and lasts a while. I’ve heard others having there’s for more than three years. I recommend these if you have issues with ear comfort with other ones. These are comfortable. Love them
Update… I did not like them after a couple days. They did start falling out with my oily ears. They wouldn’t stay in. I ordered the 2 generation pros and I’m Inlove and boy are they loud. Spend a few extra dollars and get the pros for better ear support and comfort. I’m never going back to anything else. My last review"

These wireless earbuds have become an essential companion for her daily activities, from listening to music and podcasts to taking calls and engaging in virtual classes.

One of the standout features of the AirPods 2nd Gen is their seamless connectivity with Apple devices. The pairing process is incredibly easy, and once connected, they automatically sync with her iPhone, iPad, and other Apple devices. This simplicity and convenience have made her life much easier, as she can switch between devices effortlessly without any interruption.

The sound quality of the AirPods is outstanding. They deliver clear, crisp audio with excellent bass, enhancing her music-listening experience. Whether she's enjoying her favorite tunes or watching videos, the AirPods ensure an immersive sound experience without any distortion.

The design of the AirPods is both sleek and comfortable. They fit perfectly in her ears, and she can wear them for extended periods without any discomfort. The earbuds' lightweight construction allows her to use them during workouts, without worrying about them falling out or causing any irritation.

Battery life has been impressive as well. The AirPods hold a charge for several hours of continuous use, and the included charging case provides multiple additional charges on the go, ensuring they are always ready for use.

Moreover, the AirPods' portability and compact charging case allow her to carry them anywhere conveniently. The case also offers protection and keeps the AirPods safe when not in use."

April,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023","I've been using the Apple AirPods 2nd Generation for a few weeks now, and I'm absolutely blown away by their performance. The wireless connection is rock solid, and the sound quality is fantastic. Whether I'm listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the audio is clear and crisp, with just the right amount of bass.

The convenience of the wireless design cannot be overstated. It's liberating to move around without any cords getting in the way, and the AirPods stay comfortably in my ears, even during workouts. The lightning charging case is a great addition – it keeps my AirPods protected and provides multiple charges on the go. Setup was a breeze; they connected seamlessly to my iPhone as soon as I opened the case.

The touch controls are intuitive and responsive. I can pause/play, skip tracks, and even activate Siri with a simple tap. Speaking of Siri, the voice recognition is surprisingly accurate, making it easy to make calls and send messages hands-free.

Battery life is solid; I can easily get through a day of use without needing to recharge the case. The seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem is a huge plus – I can switch between devices effortlessly, and the automatic pausing when I remove an AirPod is a small but brilliant feature.

While they might seem a bit pricey, the Apple AirPods 2nd Generation are worth every penny for the audio quality, convenience, and overall user experience they provide. If you're looking for top-notch wireless earbuds, these are definitely worth considering!"

Why pay an unreasonable price to hurt your ears? Then again we are a society that has to have the newest most expensive thing because we need to keep up with Mr. and Mrs. Jones, right? So I guess if that’s your thing, go ahead and buy the new generation, but these are much better and more comfortable so I will stick with the older generations. I’ve never been one to have to keep up with the crowd. I hate contributing to the over market of happening to buy the brand. New iPhone is brand new earbuds and happening to keep out dating of things every year and make things insufficient. It only contributes to the increase of the landfills so I’m gonna give props to every single person who purchases an older generation and refurbished items. And if you buy it, just because you are on a frugal and or frugal budget or you’re a broke person and just want an earbud that is good quality I will give props to you too, because without knowing it you are purchasing something that is not going with the flow of society"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2023","Let me explain why I rated the battery life to be so low. As of now, I bought these airpods in 2020 and at the tail end of 2022, and more recently in 2023, the battery slowly declined. Although I understand that these products don't last forever, I still wanted to point out that the battery life deteriorated after only two years of use..
Within the first 1.5-2 years of use, the battery was great! I went a whole day or three without having to charge them. The right air bud died much quicker than the left, even though I put them on at the same time. After two and a half years, both AirPods batteries died quickly. Since January, the left one doesn't last as long and I can only use the right one for 10 minutes. I used to connect them to my HP, but since January, it no longer works. I'm debating on ordering more because they are useful when using my phone."

Cyndi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2023","I’ve had my Apple iPods for a while now, after buying probably six or seven of the less expensive pairs. It is worth the extra expense, believe me. My husband asked me to get him a pair, and he absolutely loves them. He wears them every time he’s exercising or goes out for a walk. They come in very clearly and you can take phone calls as well as listen to your favorite tunes. I would highly recommend."
Tom Nisbet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023","I like them more than expected. I would have enjoyed the newer version with volume control but I grew up without remotes of any kind. After a number of hours the batteries will need charged but during sleepless nights I can enjoy music while the wife sleeps. This model wasn’t built with complete noise reduction, both a good/bad situation, I’m not oblivious to the world."

Keith Mosley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023","These airpods are great as long as you are not looking for noise cancelling, they cancel a little but of noise but not much, in my case I use them for work and they are perfect because I can still hear if someone calls my name while still listening to my music."
