# Amazon Reviews Comparative Analysis

This project consists of two Python notebooks aimed at conducting a comparative analysis of customer reviews for two competitive products on Amazon.com. The project is designed to scrape all available information for each customer review, save the results in separate CSV files for each product, and generate a comparative report based on the collected data.

## Notebook 1: Data Scraping

**Notebook Name: amazon_earbuds_review_extraction.ipynb**
**Objective:** This notebook scrapes customer reviews for two competitive products on Amazon.com.
**Steps:**

1. Select two competitive products with at least 500 reviews each on Amazon.com.
2. Utilize web scraping techniques to collect information from customer reviews.
3. Save the results in separate CSV files for each product.

## Notebook 2: Comparative Analysis

**Notebook Name: comparativeReport.ipynb**
**Objective:** This notebook reads the review CSV files produced by the first notebook and generates a comparative report describing how the two products differ based on customer reviews.
**Steps:**

1. Read the review CSV files for each product.
1. Analyze and compare the customer reviews for insights.
1. Produce a comparative report highlighting the differences between the two products.

### Deliverables

- Two Python notebooks (`amazon_earbuds_review_extraction.ipynb` and `comparativeReport.ipynb`).
- CSV files containing the scraped reviews for each product.
- A zip file containing all the notebooks and review data.

### Instructions

1. Run `amazon_earbuds_review_extraction.ipynb` to collect customer reviews and save CSV files.
1. Run `comparativeReport.ipynb` to generate a comparative report based on the collected review data.
